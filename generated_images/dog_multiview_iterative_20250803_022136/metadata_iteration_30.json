  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for precise 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog consistently in all 16 images, ensuring absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Pay careful attention to capturing the dog's unique features consistently across all views to facilitate accurate 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images neatly in a 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly defined to allow for easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to present a full three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Each angle should reveal unique aspects of the dog's anatomy, enhancing the spatial information available for reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced and consistent lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring or exposure issues to ensure high-quality detail clarity and visibility.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus solely on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any variations.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for effective and precise 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently display the same dog across all 16 squares, which is essential for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency severely impacts the utility of the dataset for creating accurate 3D models. However, the grid layout is executed well, with clearly defined and equally sized squares that aid in visual comparison and analysis. The variety of angles provided is sufficient for ensuring multiple perspectives, which would be beneficial for modeling if other criteria were fulfilled. The images are sharp, detailed, and well-lit, enhancing the clarity of details needed for modeling. Minor variations in background consistency could be adjusted to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
