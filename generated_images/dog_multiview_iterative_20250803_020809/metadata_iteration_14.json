  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction, and it must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the exact same dog is featured in all 16 images, maintaining uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size across the entire set.\n   - Focus on consistent representation of the dog's unique features, ensuring clear and unambiguous identification.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a precise 4x4 grid, with each square being the same size and clearly defined to facilitate straightforward comparison and analysis across different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a broad spectrum of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to offer a comprehensive visual representation of the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Each angle should be carefully selected to provide unique insights that are beneficial for thorough 3D modeling.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to clearly highlight the dog's features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain consistent image quality and detail visibility.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Maintain a uniform white background throughout all images to ensure the dog remains the focal point and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across the entire set to eliminate any variations in background lighting, ensuring a seamless presentation.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to maintain a balanced and uniform grid presentation, optimizing for visual analysis and focus.\n- Use a fixed camera setup and standardized studio lighting to ensure uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct rigorous quality assurance checks post-capture to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently display the same dog across all 16 squares, crucially impacting its suitability for 3D reconstruction. The inconsistency in the dog's appearance makes it inappropriate for accurate 3D modeling. Despite this, the grid layout is commendable, with clearly defined and equally sized squares, ensuring an organized presentation. The angle diversity is sufficient, providing a range of perspectives that could be beneficial for capturing different views if the set were consistent. Image clarity is excellent, with sharp, detailed images that are well-lit, contributing positively to the visibility of fine details. Slight variations in background lighting should be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across the images.",
