  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for high-quality 3D reconstruction, and it must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure uniformity and clarity:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, ensuring complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size throughout the set.\n   - Focus on maintaining consistent visualization of the dog's unique features across all viewpoints for accurate modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a well-defined 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and clearly demarcated. This enables straightforward comparison and analysis of different angles.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, capturing views from the front, back, sides, and diagonals to offer a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog's form.\n   - Select angles that reveal diverse aspects of the dog to aid in a thorough reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution and sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring or exposure issues to maintain optimal detail visibility and quality.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a uniform white background for all images to ensure the dog remains the focal point and to facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Implement controlled lighting across the entire set to maintain an even background appearance, eliminating any inconsistencies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and dimension analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and consistent studio lighting to preserve uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Perform thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm adherence to all criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will enhance the practicality and reliability of the multiview image set for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently display the same dog across all 16 squares, a critical requirement for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency makes the dataset unsuitable for effective modeling. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equally sized squares that facilitate easy comparison and analysis. The variety of angles is adequate, providing a range of perspectives necessary for thorough 3D modeling, although this is undermined by the inconsistency in the dogs shown. The image clarity is excellent, with images being sharp, detailed, and well-lit, improving visibility and detail capture. Minor variations in background lighting should be addressed for complete uniformity across images.",
