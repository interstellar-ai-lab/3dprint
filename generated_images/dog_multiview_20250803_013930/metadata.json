  "prompt": "**Title:** 16-View Dog Display for 3D Reconstruction\n\n**Description:**\n\nCreate a single image that visually showcases a dog from 16 different perspectives arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. Each square in this grid should feature the same dog, meticulously captured from a different viewing angle to assist in 3D reconstruction analysis. The dog should be positioned in an outdoor setting with natural lighting, which helps emphasize the texture and detail of its fur. \n\n1. **Dog Description:**\n   - **Breed:** Golden Retriever\n   - **Coat:** Smooth, thick, and golden in color\n   - **Size:** Medium build\n   - **Distinguishing Features:** Friendly expression, playful posture\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - **Arrangement:** 4x4 grid consisting of 16 squares\n   - **Perspective Variety:** Include perspectives such as front, back, sides, diagonal views, and top-down shots to comprehensively cover all angles\n   - **Consistency:** Each image should maintain a similar background, lighting, and setting to ensure uniformity across the grid\n\n3. **Background:**\n   - A grassy field with a few shadows to enhance realism\n   - Soft, indirect sunlight to highlight the dog's coat naturally\n\n4. **Lighting:**\n   - Ensure even lighting across all views to minimize harsh shadows\n   - Subtle highlights to accentuate the dog's features without overshadowing its natural appearance\n\n5. **Composition Tips:**\n   - Ensure the dog is centered in each grid square for balanced composition\n   - The dog's size should be consistent across all views to keep the focus primarily on the change in angle \n\nThis prompt should result in a comprehensive multiview depiction of the dog, facilitating 3D analysis and visualization tasks.",
