  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for precise 3D reconstruction, and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the same dog in all 16 images, maintaining absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, size, and posture.\n   - Focus on representing the dog's unique features consistently across all views to facilitate accurate and seamless 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precise 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly defined to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to fully capture the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Choose angles that reveal diverse aspects of the dog's anatomy to enrich the reconstruction process with detailed spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with evenly balanced lighting to clearly highlight the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure optimal visibility of details.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a consistent white background across all images to keep the focus on the dog and to facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled and consistent lighting conditions across all images to maintain an evenly lit background and eliminate any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Employ a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to preserve uniformity throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm adherence to all criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set does not consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is essential for 3D reconstruction. This lack of consistency significantly limits the utility of the images for creating an accurate 3D model. Nonetheless, the grid layout is well-executed, with each square being equal in size and clearly defined, which aids in visual comparison. The variety of angles is adequate for providing multiple perspectives necessary for comprehensive modeling, although the inconsistency issue reduces its effectiveness. The images demonstrate excellent clarity, with sharp, well-lit captures that enhance detail visibility. Minor variations in background lighting should be addressed to achieve complete uniformity across all views.",
