  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image displaying 16 different views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is intended for accurate 3D reconstruction, and it must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure optimal quality, consistency, and usability:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the same dog in all 16 squares with no variation in breed, color, markings, or size.\n   - Focus on highlighting the dog's unique features uniformly across all views to maintain clear recognition and consistency.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the views within a precise 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly defined to facilitate easy comparison of different angles.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Cover a comprehensive range of perspectives, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to adequately capture the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Select each angle purposefully to reveal useful and unique aspects of the dog\u2019s anatomy for reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Ensure each image is high-resolution and sharply detailed, utilizing balanced lighting to effectively highlight the dog's features.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to preserve detail and clarity throughout the set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Use a consistent white background for all images, ensuring the dog remains the primary focus and facilitating easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Employ controlled lighting to maintain a uniform background appearance across all images, eliminating inconsistencies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation.\n- Utilize a fixed camera setup and consistent lighting configuration to preserve uniformity throughout the session.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks once all images are captured to confirm adherence to all criteria for consistency and quality.\n\nThis enhanced prompt will significantly improve the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image fails to show the exact same dog consistently across all 16 squares, which is crucial for 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency in appearance renders the dataset unusable for creating an accurate 3D model. The grid layout, however, is effectively organized, with each square being clearly defined and of equal size, making it easy to analyze each view. The diversity of angles is sufficient to provide a comprehensive understanding of the dog's form, which would be beneficial if consistency were maintained. Image clarity is great, with each image being sharp and well-lit, maximizing visibility and detail capture. Background consistency is generally good, though slight variations in lighting can be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
