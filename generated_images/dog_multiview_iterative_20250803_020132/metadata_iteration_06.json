  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the EXACT SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This configuration is intended for high-quality 3D reconstruction purposes and must adhere to the following guidelines:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture all 16 images using the same dog, ensuring perfect consistency in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus meticulously on unique identification features of the dog to ensure uniformity throughout the image set.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the image set into a clear and precise 4x4 grid, with equally sized and neatly aligned squares to facilitate seamless viewing and comparison.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of viewing angles such as front, back, both sides, and diagonals, ensuring a complete spatial understanding of the dog\u2019s form.\n   - Each angle should be distinct yet harmonize with the others to form a complete set.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Ensure high-resolution and sharply detailed images with appropriate lighting that highlight the dog's features prominently.\n   - Avoid any blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maximize the visibility of important details.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a consistent white background for all images to maintain focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize uniform and controlled lighting across all shots to ensure an even background and eliminate any lighting discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to maintain uniformity and balance within the grid.\n- Utilize a fixed camera setup and studio lighting to ensure consistency across the photoshoot.\n- Conduct thorough checks after capturing the images to confirm that all consistency criteria are fully met.\n\nThis enhanced approach will significantly improve the quality and reliability of the multiview image set for 3D reconstruction, addressing prior inconsistencies and enhancing overall image uniformity and detail.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image of the dog does not consistently feature the same dog across all 16 images, which is a critical requirement for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly reduces the usefulness of the image set for reconstruction purposes. The grid layout is well-executed, providing a clear and uniform arrangement of images. The diversity of angles presented is adequate, capturing a range of perspectives necessary for comprehensive modeling. The images exhibit outstanding clarity, being sharp and well-lit, which could aid in detailing if the consistency issue were resolved. Background consistency is mostly good, with only slight variations that could be improved to maintain uniformity across all images.",
