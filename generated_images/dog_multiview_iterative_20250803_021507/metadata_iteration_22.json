  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in each of the 16 squares, maintaining complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size throughout the set.\n   - Ensure that the dog's unique features are consistently represented across all views to enable precise and accurate 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a perfectly defined 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate direct comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, capturing front, back, sides, and diagonal views to provide a full three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Choose angles that reveal diverse aspects of the dog\u2019s form, enhancing details necessary for thorough reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced and consistent lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all views.\n   - Avoid issues like blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain high-quality detail visibility and image clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background throughout all images to ensure the dog remains the focal point and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Implement controlled and even lighting across the entire set to ensure a consistently lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image fails to consistently display the same dog across all 16 squares, which is critical for accurate 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency severely limits the potential to create an effective 3D model from the image set. Nevertheless, the grid layout is efficiently executed, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that support effective comparison. The diversity of angles is sufficient to cover different perspectives necessary for capturing the dog's three-dimensional characteristics, although it is undermined by the inconsistency issue. The images exhibit high clarity, with sharpness and appropriate lighting enhancing the visibility of details. Minor variations in background lighting should be minimized to ensure total uniformity across all images.",
