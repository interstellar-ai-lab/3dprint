  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image that presents 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is critical for high-quality 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure consistency and accuracy:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the exact same dog is captured consistently across all 16 images, maintaining uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on the dog's unique features such as facial markings, posture, and fur texture, ensuring these are consistently represented in every view.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images neatly in a clearly defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to fully capture the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Choose angles that reveal diverse aspects of the dog's anatomy to enhance the 3D reconstruction process by providing detailed spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring or improper exposure to ensure optimal detail visibility and clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Use consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to depict the exact same dog consistently across all 16 views, which is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency renders the set unsuitable for accurate modeling purposes. Positively, the grid layout is well-organized, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that make visual comparison straightforward. The diversity of angles is adequate, offering various perspectives necessary for comprehensive 3D modeling, albeit the inconsistency detracts from this benefit. The images boast high clarity, being sharp and well-lit, enhancing detail visibility. However, slight discrepancies in background lighting should be minimized to ensure a uniformly consistent appearance across the images.",
