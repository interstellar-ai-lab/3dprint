  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for effective 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Use the exact same dog for all 16 images, ensuring complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size across every view.\n   - Pay attention to clearly capturing the dog's unique features such as facial expressions, body shape, and fur texture consistently in each image.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a well-defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly demarcated to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, capturing the dog from front, back, sides, and diagonals to form a complete three-dimensional representation.\n   - Ensure each angle provides unique insights into the dog\u2019s structure, contributing effectively to the 3D modeling process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced lighting to ensure clear visibility of the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Avoid any blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain high-quality detail visibility throughout the grid.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Implement a uniform white background for all images to keep the emphasis on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across all images to ensure an even background appearance, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and consistent grid presentation, optimizing for focus and detail analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to consistently display the exact same dog across all 16 squares, which is a crucial requirement for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly reduces the dataset's utility for accurate modeling. Nevertheless, the grid layout is well-executed, with each square clearly defined and of equal size, making it easy to compare different views. The diversity of angles is adequate, offering various perspectives necessary for thorough modeling, but the inconsistency undermines this advantage. Image clarity is excellent, with sharp, well-lit images that improve detail visibility. There are minor variations in background lighting that should be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across all views.",
