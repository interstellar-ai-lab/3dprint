  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout for optimal 3D reconstruction purposes. Follow these detailed guidelines to enhance quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Utilize the exact same dog in all 16 squares, ensuring uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on capturing distinctive details of the dog's features to maintain recognition across all views.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the views in a precise 4x4 grid with clearly defined and equally sized squares, allowing each perspective to be distinct and noticeable.\n   \n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Offer a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals.\n   - Ensure all angles are strategically chosen to cover the full scope of the dog\u2019s form for detailed 3D modeling.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Maintain exceptional image quality with sharp, high-resolution captures.\n   - Use controlled and even lighting to enhance visibility of the dog\u2019s features, avoiding shadows or overexposure.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background consistently across all views to ensure the dog's presence is central without background distraction.\n   - Implement uniform lighting across the grid to avoid any lighting discrepancies that affect image consistency.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Use a stable camera setup and lighting arrangement to ensure consistency throughout the photoshoot.\n- Verify that the dog\u2019s posture and features remain consistent across images to prevent variation.\n- Conduct thorough quality checks before finalizing the images to ensure all criteria are met.\n\nThis approach will greatly improve the quality of the multiview image set for 3D reconstruction, ensuring the highest level of detail and consistency.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image critically fails to display the same dog across all 16 squares, which is necessary for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency can compromise the creation of a coherent 3D model. The grid layout is commendable, with all squares being equally defined and well-arranged, facilitating easy comparison between views. The diversity of angles presented is appropriate, as it encompasses a wide range of perspectives necessary for capturing detailed spatial information. However, this is undermined by the inconsistency in the subject. The image clarity is strong, with sharp, well-focused images that are well-lit, enabling clear viewing of details. Background consistency is mostly stable, though minor lighting adjustments could enhance uniformity.",
