  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image that showcases 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for precise 3D reconstruction, and must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog consistently in all 16 images, ensuring uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on maintaining consistent representation of the dog's unique features such as facial markings, tail position, and body proportions across all views.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images within a precisely defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly demarcated to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to provide a full three-dimensional representation of the dog's form.\n   - Ensure each angle offers unique information that enhances the understanding of the dog's structure for thorough reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced lighting to clearly highlight the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure that every detail is visible and clear.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a consistent white background for all images to maintain focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the 3D reconstruction process.\n   - Employ controlled and even lighting across the set to ensure a uniform background appearance, eliminating any variations.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to maintain a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation that optimizes focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to ensure uniformity and consistency throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will result in a multiview image set that is highly suitable for accurate and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails in showing the same dog consistently across all 16 squares, a critical factor for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency greatly diminishes the set's utility for accurate modeling. Positively, the grid layout is well-executed, with each square being equally spaced and clearly defined, enhancing visual comparison. The diversity of angles is sufficient, offering a range of perspectives required for detailed modeling, but this advantage is lost due to the variation in the dogs shown. Image clarity is impressive, with sharp and well-lit images that aid in detail visibility. Minor inconsistencies in the background lighting should be corrected to achieve total uniformity across images.",
