  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image showcasing 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, ensuring complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on capturing the dog\u2019s unique features consistently across all views to facilitate precise 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a well-defined 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to capture a full three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Choose angles that highlight unique features of the dog to enhance the reconstruction process with detailed spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced and consistent lighting to clearly highlight the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure optimal detail visibility and clarity throughout the image set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background for all images to maintain focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize consistent, controlled lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity and consistency throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently display the same dog across all 16 squares, which is essential for accurate 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly undermines the set's utility for effective modeling. However, the grid layout is well-organized, with each square clearly defined and equal in size, facilitating effective visual comparison. The range of angles captured is adequate, providing necessary perspectives for comprehensive 3D modeling, although the inconsistency renders this less effective. Image clarity is high, with sharp, well-lit images that enhance detail capture. Minor variations in background lighting should be addressed to achieve complete uniformity across all views.",
