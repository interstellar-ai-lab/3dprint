  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nGenerate a single image containing 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image is for precise 3D reconstruction and must meet the following requirements:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:** \n   - Ensure all 16 images depict the exact same dog, maintaining consistency in breed, color, markings, and size across all views.\n   - Capture the dog's unique features with precision to ensure accurate recognition in every image.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Use a 4x4 grid with clearly defined and equally sized squares to distinctly separate each view.\n   - Position the dog centrally in each square to maintain uniformity and focus.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a wide range of viewing angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals.\n   - Ensure angles are varied but complementary, capturing all aspects of the dog's anatomy.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Guarantee high-resolution images that are sharp and detailed.\n   - Use adequate lighting to highlight the dog\u2019s features without casting harsh shadows or glare.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a uniform white background to ensure the dog remains the focal point and to facilitate clean separation in the reconstruction process.\n   - Maintain consistent lighting across all images to avoid any variations in background appearance.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Use stationary camera and lighting setups to prevent any changes between shots.\n- Employ neutral lighting setups to minimize color distortion and maintain visual consistency.\n- Conduct quality checks to confirm the dog\u2019s posture and visual properties match in every shot before finalizing the image set.\n\nThis structured approach will enhance the overall quality and suitability of the image set for 3D reconstruction purposes.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fundamentally fails in showing the same dog consistently across all 16 squares, which is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction. As a result, the suitability for reconstruction is drastically reduced. On a positive note, the grid layout is well-organized, providing a clear structure with evenly sized squares that make the views accessible. The variety of angles presented is adequate, offering a range of perspectives needed for comprehensive 3D modeling if other consistency issues were resolved. Clarity in the images is excellent, showcasing sharpness and appropriate lighting, which are commendable attributes for image quality. The background is mostly consistent with slight variations that could be improved with better lighting management.",
