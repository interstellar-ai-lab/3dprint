  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This set must meet the following detailed criteria to maximize its quality for accurate 3D reconstruction:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that every image in the 16-square grid features the exact same dog, maintaining consistency in breed, color, markings, and size throughout the set.\n   - Pay close attention to clearly showing the dog\u2019s unique identifying features across all perspectives to aid in consistent recognition and accuracy for reconstruction.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a well-defined 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and clarity. This layout should facilitate easy cross-comparison of all angles provided.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of angles to illustrate the dog's three-dimensional form, including views from the front, back, sides, and diagonals.\n   - Each angle should be thoughtfully selected to offer unique and informative perspectives that enhance the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced and uniform lighting to highlight the dog's features without distortion.\n   - Avoid any issues such as blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure the highest level of detail and quality.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a uniform white background for all images, ensuring the dog remains the sole focus and aiding in clear segmentation for reconstruction.\n   - Implement consistent, controlled lighting to eliminate any variations in the background, ensuring a uniform appearance across the entire image set.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for a balanced and consistent presentation throughout the grid.\n- Use a fixed camera setup and identical lighting conditions to maintain overall uniformity during the photoshoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality checks to ensure all images meet these criteria before finalizing the image set.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will enhance the practicality and reliability of the multiview image set for effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is vital for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency results in the set being unsuitable for creating an accurate 3D model. The grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equally sized squares that allow easy viewing and comparison. The diversity of angles is sufficient to provide varied perspectives necessary for detailed modeling, though the inconsistency in the subject undermines this advantage. Image clarity is excellent, with high sharpness and appropriate lighting that enhances the visibility of details. There are minor lighting variations affecting background consistency, which could be improved to maintain uniformity across all images.",
