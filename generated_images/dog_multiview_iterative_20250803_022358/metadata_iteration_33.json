  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is critical for precise 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure consistency and high quality:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Photograph the exact same dog in all 16 images, maintaining complete consistency in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Ensure that the dog's unique features, such as specific markings, ear shape, and tail position, are consistently captured across each view to facilitate precise 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a clearly defined 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and neatly separated to maintain a structured layout that supports easy visual analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a wide range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to offer a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog's form.\n   - Each angle should highlight distinct features of the dog's anatomy to enhance the detail and accuracy of the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced and consistent lighting to ensure clear visibility of the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain high detail visibility and quality throughout the image set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a uniform white background in all images to ensure the dog remains the focal point and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Implement consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background and eliminate any visual discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently display the same dog in all 16 squares, which is critical for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency compromises the dataset's utility for accurate modeling. However, the grid layout is executed well, with each square clearly defined and equal in size, facilitating easy comparison. The variety of angles is adequate, providing multiple perspectives necessary for comprehensive modeling, though the inconsistency undermines its effectiveness. Image clarity is excellent, with sharp, well-lit images that better capture details. There are minor variations in background lighting that need adjustment to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
