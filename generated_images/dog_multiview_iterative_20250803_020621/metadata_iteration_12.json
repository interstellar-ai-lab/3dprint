  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the identical dog is captured in all 16 squares, with no variations in breed, color, markings, or size.\n   - Focus on capturing unique and consistent features of the dog across all views to ensure uniformity.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the views in a precise 4x4 grid, with equal-sized and clearly defined squares to facilitate seamless comparison of different angles.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to completely represent the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Each angle should be purposively chosen to provide informative perspectives beneficial for 3D modeling.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Ensure all images are high-resolution, sharply detailed, and well-lit to highlight the dog's features without distortion or loss of detail.\n   - Avoid any blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain visual clarity across the set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Maintain a consistent white background across all images to ensure the dog remains the primary focus and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Use controlled and even lighting to prevent background inconsistencies, ensuring a uniform appearance throughout.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to maintain a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation that optimizes focus and analysis.\n- Utilize a fixed camera setup and consistent studio lighting to ensure uniformity across the shooting session.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks after capturing the images to confirm adherence to all criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdherence to these guidelines will enhance the suitability and quality of the multiview image set for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to consistently display the same dog across the 16 squares, which is crucial for reliable 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly limits the set's utility for modeling. Despite this, the grid layout is efficiently organized, providing clearly defined and equally sized squares that aid in analyzing each view. The angle diversity is adequate, offering various perspectives necessary for a comprehensive model. The images are clear, sharp, and well-lit, which enhances detail capture. However, there are minor inconsistencies in background lighting that could be improved to maintain uniformity across all images.",
