  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nGenerate a single composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction and must strictly adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Photograph the exact same dog for all 16 images, maintaining complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on consistently capturing the dog\u2019s unique features, such as specific markings, ear shapes, and tail position across all views.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a clearly defined 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and precisely separated to facilitate straightforward comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, capturing the dog from the front, back, sides, and diagonals to create a complete three-dimensional representation.\n   - Ensure each angle provides a unique and valuable perspective that enhances the reconstruction process by offering detailed spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly in each view.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure maximum detail visibility and image clarity across all images.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Utilize a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the 3D reconstruction process.\n   - Implement consistent, controlled lighting across all views to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any variances.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity and consistency during the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before compiling the image set.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction. This lack of consistency significantly impacts the utility of the dataset for accurate modeling. However, the grid layout is commendable, with all squares clearly defined and of equal size, facilitating easy analysis and comparison of views. The variety of angles is satisfactory, providing multiple perspectives necessary for detailed 3D modeling, but this advantage is negated by the inconsistency issue. Image clarity is impressive, with sharp and well-lit images enhancing detail visibility. Some variations in background lighting exist and should be minimized to achieve complete uniformity across all images.",
