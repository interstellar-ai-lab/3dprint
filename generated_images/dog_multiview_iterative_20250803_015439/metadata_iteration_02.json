  "prompt": "**Improved Prompt:**\n\nGenerate a single image displaying 16 distinct, high-quality views of the same dog in a 4x4 grid layout. Each square should precisely capture the dog from a unique viewing angle, ensuring comprehensive coverage for 3D reconstruction. Focus on maintaining equal-sized squares with sharply defined grid lines to enhance image organization. Prioritize consistent clarity and sharpness across all views, with well-balanced lighting to avoid blur or shadow inconsistencies. Diverse angles are crucial\u2014explore both common and less-obvious perspectives of the dog to maximize angle diversity and reduce redundancy. Keep the background uniformly white for all views to aid in processing for 3D modeling.",

  "feedback": "The grid layout is well-implemented with equal-sized squares, which creates a clean and organized presentation, conducive for 3D reconstruction analysis. The same dog is mostly shown consistently throughout the series of images; however, small discrepancies in alignment or posture in a few views could slightly affect uniformity. The selection of angles offers a reasonable diversity, capturing the object from various important perspectives, but further unique positions could enhance coverage. The images are generally sharp and sufficiently detailed, though slight improvements in lighting could reduce subtle shadows and enhance clarity. The white background is predominantly consistent, with very minor fluctuations, facilitating background segmentation in processing.",
