  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid. This image set is designed specifically for high-quality 3D reconstruction and should adhere to the following guidelines to ensure accuracy and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that all 16 images capture the same dog, maintaining uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size across every view.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Display the views within a precisely structured 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly defined to facilitate easy comparison across different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of angles, including the front, sides, back, and diagonals, to provide complete spatial information for comprehensive modeling.\n   - Ensure each angle is distinct but complements the others to form a cohesive set.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Maintain high-resolution images with exceptional sharpness and well-balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features distinctly.\n   - Avoid any blurring or underexposure issues to maximize detail visibility.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Use a consistent white background throughout all 16 images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy separation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize uniform lighting conditions to maintain a constant appearance across the entire grid, avoiding variations in shading or color temperature.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally in each square to maintain focus and symmetry across views.\n- Use a static camera setup and controlled, even lighting to ensure consistency throughout the photoshoot.\n- Perform thorough checks for consistency in the dog\u2019s posture, lighting, and image quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nThis improved prompt will ensure the production of a multiview image set suitable for high-quality and precise 3D reconstruction, addressing previous inconsistencies and enhancing overall reliability.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction. Any variation in dog appearance can significantly affect the modeling outcome. The grid layout is organized well, with equally sized and clearly defined squares, which helps in assessing the different views. The angle variety is adequate, allowing a wide range of perspectives to be captured, though it falls short due to the inconsistency in the dog's portrayal. The images exhibit high clarity, with sharpness and good lighting contributing to detail visibility. However, slight variations in lighting affect the background consistency across the images, which could be improved for a more uniform appearance.",
