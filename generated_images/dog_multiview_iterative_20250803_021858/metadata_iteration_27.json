  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for precise 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog consistently across all 16 images, ensuring complete uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on the dog's unique features, such as facial markings, body shape, and fur pattern, ensuring these are consistently captured in every view.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precisely defined 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate easy viewing and comparison.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to fully capture the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Select angles that reveal diverse aspects of the dog's anatomy to enhance the reconstruction process by providing detailed spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced and consistent lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring or improper exposure to ensure optimal detail visibility and clarity in each image.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is critical for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency renders the set unsuitable for accurate modeling. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that aid in comparison and visual analysis. The diversity of angles is adequate, offering a range of perspectives necessary for comprehensive 3D modeling. The images are sharp, detailed, and well-lit, contributing positively to detail visibility. There are slight variations in background lighting which should be addressed to achieve complete uniformity across all images.",
