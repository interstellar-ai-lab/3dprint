  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image showcasing 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set must meet the high standards necessary for accurate 3D reconstruction and adhere to the following detailed guidelines:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog consistently across all 16 images, ensuring uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Pay close attention to maintaining consistent representation of the dog's unique features such as facial markings, body shape, and fur pattern.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a well-defined 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate straightforward viewing and comparison.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, capturing views from the front, back, sides, and diagonals to fully represent the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Select angles that provide diverse insights into the dog's structure and anatomy, enhancing the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced and consistent lighting to clearly highlight the dog's features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure high-quality detail visibility and image clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background throughout all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Implement controlled and even lighting to maintain a consistently lit background, ensuring there are no visual discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to maintain a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to ensure uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to verify all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to display the same dog consistently across all 16 squares, which is crucial for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency heavily compromises the dataset's utility for effective modeling. However, the grid layout is well-defined, with equal-sized squares that support clear comparison and visual analysis. The variety of angles captured is adequate, providing a range of perspectives necessary for comprehensive 3D modeling, although it is undermined by the inconsistency issue. Image clarity is commendable, with sharp, well-lit images enhancing detail visibility. There are minor variations in background lighting that should be minimized to ensure uniformity across the images.",
