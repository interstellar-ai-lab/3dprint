  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for achieving accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following guidelines for consistent quality and detail:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the same dog is captured in all 16 squares, with absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on capturing distinctive features consistently across all images to maintain clear identification and avoid discrepancies.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a precise 4x4 grid, where each square is equal in size and clearly defined, facilitating straightforward comparison of different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of perspectives, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to provide a complete spatial representation of the dog.\n   - Ensure each angle is chosen to reveal useful and unique anatomical details beneficial for reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Utilize high-resolution, sharp images with balanced lighting to effectively detail the dog's features without distortion.\n   - Prevent blurring or improper exposures to maximize detail visibility across the entire set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Use a consistent white background for all images to maintain focus solely on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Implement controlled lighting to ensure a uniform background appearance across all images, eliminating any inconsistencies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation that optimizes focus and analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and consistent studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality checks post-capture to confirm that all images meet criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nUtilizing these guidelines will produce a multiview image set better suited for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently show the same dog in all 16 squares, a critical requirement for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency drastically reduces the set's utility for modeling purposes. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-executed, with each square being clearly defined and equal in size, facilitating easy viewing. The diversity of angles is adequate, covering a range of perspectives that would contribute to a thorough model if consistency issues were resolved. The image clarity is commendable, showing sharp and well-lit pictures that help in detailing. Background consistency is mostly uniform, but slight variations in lighting should be adjusted for complete uniformity across all images.",
