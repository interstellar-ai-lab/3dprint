  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 different views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is designed for precise 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 squares, ensuring absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Pay close attention to the dog\u2019s distinct features to maintain consistent representation across all images.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precise 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and clearly defined. This ensures easy comparison and analysis of different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views to capture the dog's full three-dimensional form.\n   - Ensure each angle provides a unique perspective to facilitate complete and accurate modeling.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution and sharply detailed images, with evenly balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features without distortion.\n   - Avoid blurriness and exposure inconsistencies to maintain high-quality detail visibility throughout the set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Use a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus on the dog and allow for easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Employ controlled and consistent lighting to ensure an even background appearance across all images, eliminating variations.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and uniform grid presentation, optimizing for visual clarity and focus.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to ensure uniformity across the photo shoot.\n- Perform thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently show the same dog in all 16 squares, which is crucial for successful 3D reconstruction. This lack of consistency makes the dataset unsuitable for accurate modeling purposes. On a positive note, the grid layout is well-organized, providing clearly defined and equal-sized squares that facilitate the analysis of each view. The diversity of angles is adequate, offering various perspectives necessary for comprehensive 3D modeling. The clarity of the images is commendable as they are sharp and well-lit, enhancing detail visibility. However, there are slight variations in background lighting that need to be addressed to ensure a fully uniform appearance across the entire set.",
