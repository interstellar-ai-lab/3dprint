  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 different views of the SAME dog in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog consistently across all 16 images, ensuring absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on maintaining consistent representation of the dog's unique features across all views to aid in precise 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a precisely defined 4x4 grid, with equal-sized and clearly demarcated squares to enable easy comparison and analysis of each view.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of viewing angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to provide a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Select angles that offer diverse insights into the dog's anatomy, enhancing the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all angles.\n   - Avoid any blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure high-quality detail visibility and image clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background across all images to maintain focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the 3D reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize consistent, controlled lighting to ensure a uniformly lit background, eliminating any visual discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog within each square to maintain a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation that optimizes detail analysis and focus.\n- Employ a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to preserve uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to verify all criteria for consistency and quality are achieved before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to show the exact same dog consistently across all 16 squares, which is crucial for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency severely impacts its suitability for modeling purposes. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-implemented, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that facilitate viewing and comparison. The diversity of angles provided is adequate, covering various perspectives necessary for a comprehensive model, though hindered by the inconsistency issue. Image clarity is commendable, with sharp and well-lit images that enhance detail capture. Minor variations in background lighting should be addressed to ensure a consistently uniform appearance across all images.",
