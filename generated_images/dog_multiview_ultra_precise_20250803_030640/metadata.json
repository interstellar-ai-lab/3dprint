  "base_prompt": "Photograph a Golden Retriever standing in a professional studio setting. The dog's coat should be rich and glossy, predominantly golden in color with distinct, lighter cream-colored feathering on the chest, tail, and undersides. Capture the dog's expressive dark brown eyes and signature floppy ears, ensuring the face is full of character and intelligence. The photograph must have a plain white background to eliminate distractions and provide a clean, crisp contrast. Utilize professional lighting for even illumination without harsh shadows, maintaining sharp focus throughout the image. The dog should stand in a neutral pose, with all four legs grounded, and the head held naturally, displaying a calm demeanor. Ensure the dog is consistently framed at a medium distance from the camera, centered in the image, and occupying a similar proportion of the frame for consistency across all views. The professional photography style will aid in capturing these details accurately, making it ideal for a 4-view multiview set for 3D reconstruction.",
