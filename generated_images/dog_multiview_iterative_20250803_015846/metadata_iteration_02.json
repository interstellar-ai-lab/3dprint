  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single image containing 16 different views of the EXACT SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. **Critical Requirements:** \n\n1. **Dog Consistency:** Ensure all 16 squares feature the identical dog \u2014 the same breed, color, markings, and size. This is crucial for successful 3D reconstruction.\n   \n2. **Grid Layout:** Maintain a clear and equal division of the 4x4 grid to present each perspective distinctly.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:** Capture a variety of distinct viewing angles. Ensure the front, back, sides, and various diagonal perspectives of the dog are covered to provide comprehensive spatial information.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:** Each view must be sharp, with high-resolution details and well-lit environments to enhance the visibility of the dog's features.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:** Utilize a uniform white background for all 16 views to ensure the dog remains the primary focus without distracting elements. Adjust lighting to achieve a consistent background appearance throughout.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally in each square to maintain focus.\n- Capture high-resolution images to facilitate detailing.\n- Consistency in lighting will ensure uniformity, so use studio lighting or a similar controlled light source.\n- Use neutral lighting to prevent color casting on the fur.\n- Avoid any motion blur or variations in the dog's posture between shots to ensure consistency.\n\nThis configuration will significantly enhance the suitability of the resulting image set for precise 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image fails to show the exact same dog in all 16 squares, which is a critical requirement for effective 3D reconstruction. This disrupts the consistency needed to accurately model the dog in three dimensions. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equally sized squares that facilitate viewing. The diversity of angles is satisfactory, providing varied perspectives necessary for capturing the dog's form. The images are clear, sharp, and well-lit, which enhances the potential for detailing in 3D models. However, slight variations in background lighting need attention to improve overall consistency.",
