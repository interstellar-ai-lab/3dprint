  "base_prompt": "Capture a professional, high-resolution image of a Golden Retriever standing on a seamless white background. The Golden Retriever should display its classic golden coat with slight variations of lighter and darker shades that shimmer under the good lighting conditions. Ensure the fur is smooth and slightly wavy, highlighting the natural sheen and texture. Focus sharply on the distinct friendly and intelligent expression, with dark brown, soulful eyes that contrast against the golden fur. Pay particular attention to its broad head, medium-sized ears that flop down, and the characteristic thick, straight tail held naturally. The nose should be black, providing a stark contrast with the golden coat. Use soft, diffused lighting to minimize shadows and enhance the coat's details, keeping the background completely white for emphasis. Capture the dog in a standing position, evenly distributing its weight on all four legs to show posture and form, with straight legs and paws firmly on the ground. This image is intended as part of a 4-view multiview set for 3D reconstruction, so consistency in color, texture, and features is crucial across different angles.",
