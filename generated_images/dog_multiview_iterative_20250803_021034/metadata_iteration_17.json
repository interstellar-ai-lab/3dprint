  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image showcasing 16 different views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for precise 3D reconstruction and must strictly adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, maintaining absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Pay attention to capturing the dog's unique features consistently across all views to facilitate accurate 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images within a precise 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is the same size and clearly defined to facilitate coherent comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views for a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Ensure each angle provides a unique perspective that adds value to the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharply detailed images with consistent lighting to distinctly highlight the dog's features across all viewing angles.\n   - Prevent issues like blurring or improper exposure to maintain high image quality and detail clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background throughout all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate straightforward segmentation in reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled, even lighting across the entire set to ensure a consistent visual background without variations.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to achieve a balanced and uniform grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and consistent studio lighting to preserve uniformity across the photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks after capturing the images to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to display the exact same dog consistently across all 16 squares, a critical requirement for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency renders the set unsuitable for creating an accurate 3D model. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-organized, with each square clearly defined and equal in size, facilitating easy comparison and analysis. The angle diversity is adequate, offering a range of perspectives necessary for comprehensive modeling. The clarity of the images is excellent, as they are sharp, detailed, and well-lit, which enhances visibility and detail capture. Minor variations in background lighting should be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
