  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image presenting 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in every image to maintain uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size across all views.\n   - Ensure that the dog's unique features are consistently displayed to facilitate clear and accurate 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images neatly in a 4x4 grid with each square being equal in size and clearly defined, allowing for effective comparison and analysis of different perspectives.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a wide range of angles, covering the front, back, sides, and diagonal views to fully represent the dog\u2019s three-dimensional form.\n   - Select angles that provide comprehensive and unique insight into the dog's features, aiding 3D reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with consistent lighting to clearly highlight the dog's features across all views.\n   - Avoid issues such as blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure the highest quality of image detail and clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background to all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during the reconstruction process.\n   - Utilize controlled and even lighting to prevent any variations in the background, ensuring a consistent visual appearance throughout the entire set.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to maintain a balanced and uniform grid presentation that optimizes focus and analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to preserve uniformity during the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm adherence to all criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nFollowing these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to consistently display the same dog in all 16 squares, which is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly undermines its utility for effective 3D modeling. However, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that aid in viewing and comparison. The angle diversity is sufficient, providing a variety of perspectives necessary for detailed modeling, although the inconsistency in depicted dogs dilutes its effectiveness. The images are clear, sharp, and well-lit, ensuring high-detail visibility. Minor inconsistencies in background lighting need improvement to achieve complete uniformity across the images.",
