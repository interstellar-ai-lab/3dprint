  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image that showcases 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog across all 16 images, maintaining uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on consistently capturing the dog's unique features, such as facial markings, fur patterns, and body shape, in every view.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precisely defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly distinguished to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to provide a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Each angle should offer unique insights into the dog's structure, enhancing the depth and effectiveness of the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced and consistent lighting to ensure clear visibility of the dog\u2019s features across all views.\n   - Eliminate blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maintain optimal detail visibility and quality throughout the image set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background for all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, minimizing any disparities or variations.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing for focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain overall uniformity and consistency throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to confirm that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image fails to consistently show the exact same dog across all 16 squares, which is crucial for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency renders the image set unsuitable for accurate 3D modeling. However, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equally sized squares, facilitating easy comparison of each view. The angle diversity is adequate, offering a variety of perspectives necessary for detailed modeling, but the inconsistency in the subject undermines this advantage. Image clarity is impressive, with sharp, well-lit images that enhance the visibility of fine details. Minor variations in background lighting should be minimized to ensure uniform consistency across all images.",
