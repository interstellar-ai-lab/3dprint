  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image presenting 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is designed for accurate 3D reconstruction, so it must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, maintaining complete consistency in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Ensure that the dog's unique features are clearly and uniformly depicted across all views to facilitate precise modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precise 4x4 grid, with each square equal in size and clearly defined to facilitate easy comparison and analysis of different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views to provide a complete three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Each angle should reveal diverse aspects of the dog\u2019s anatomy, aiding in a thorough reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution and sharply detailed images with evenly balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features clearly across all angles.\n   - Avoid issues like blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to ensure high-quality detail visibility.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background throughout all images to ensure the dog remains the focal point and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled lighting to maintain a consistent background appearance, eliminating variations across images.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing for focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain overall uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks post-capture to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The provided image set fails to show the exact same dog in all 16 squares, which is essential for accurate 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency means the dataset is not suitable for constructing a 3D model. Positively, the grid layout is excellently organized with clearly defined and equal-sized squares, making analysis straightforward. The angle diversity is adequate, offering a range of perspectives needed for thorough 3D modeling, albeit the inconsistency in the dogs undermines this benefit. Image clarity is strong, with sharp, detailed images and appropriate lighting, enhancing detail visibility. Minor lighting variations affecting background consistency should be improved to achieve complete uniformity across the images.",
