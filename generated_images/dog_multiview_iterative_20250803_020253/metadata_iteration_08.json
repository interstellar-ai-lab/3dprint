  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is intended for achieving a high-quality 3D reconstruction, requiring adherence to the following guidelines for optimal consistency and clarity:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, ensuring uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on the dog\u2019s unique identifying features to maintain consistency across all perspectives.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a precise 4x4 grid with each square being equal in size and clearly defined, allowing for easy comparison across different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of viewing angles, capturing the front, back, sides, and diagonal perspectives to offer a complete spatial representation of the dog.\n   - Each angle should complement the others to form a cohesive and complete set.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Ensure all images are high-resolution, sharply detailed, and well-lit to highlight the dog's features distinctly.\n   - Avoid blurring or exposure issues to maximize detail visibility and accuracy.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a consistent white background in all images to keep the focus solely on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled lighting to ensure even background appearance, eliminating any inconsistencies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for balanced composition and uniform focus within the grid.\n- Use a fixed camera setup and consistent studio lighting to ensure stability across the photo shoot.\n- Conduct detailed quality checks to ensure all images meet the required criteria for consistency and quality before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these comprehensive guidelines, the resulting multiview image set will be more suitable for accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently show the same dog across all 16 squares, which is critical for any successful 3D reconstruction process. This inconsistency severely hinders the suitability of the image set for accurate modeling purposes. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-organized with clear and equally sized squares that make it easier to compare the views. The diversity of angles is adequate and provides different perspectives necessary for 3D modeling. The images themselves are clear, sharp, and well-lit, which contributes positively to capturing detail. However, slight inconsistencies in background lighting could be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
