  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image showcasing 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is critical for accurate 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the exact same dog is featured in all 16 images, maintaining consistency in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on consistently capturing the dog\u2019s unique features, such as specific markings, angles of the ears, and tail position, across all views.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a precisely defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate easy comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include a comprehensive range of angles, covering front, back, sides, and diagonal views, to provide a full three-dimensional representation of the dog.\n   - Ensure each angle captures unique aspects of the dog\u2019s structure to enhance the reconstruction process.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution, sharp images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog\u2019s features clearly in every view.\n   - Avoid blurring or underexposure to maintain high detail visibility and quality throughout the image set.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background across all images to keep the focus on the dog and facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across the image set to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to ensure uniformity and consistency during the photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality assurance checks post-capture to verify that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set does not consistently display the exact same dog across all 16 squares, which is essential for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly impacts the set's suitability for accurate modeling. On the positive side, the grid layout is well-executed, with clearly defined and equal-sized squares that facilitate effective comparison and analysis. The range of angles offered is sufficient, providing various perspectives necessary for comprehensive modeling, albeit diminished by the inconsistency issue. The images are sharp and well-lit, which is positive for detail visibility. Minor variations in background lighting should be minimized to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
