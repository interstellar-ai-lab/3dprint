  "generation_metadata": "The image is designed to feature a 4x4 grid with 16 photorealistic views of a dog, aimed at enabling 3D reconstruction. Each view should precisely capture the dog from distinct angles such as front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and multiple distinct oblique angles with no repetition. Throughout each image, consistent lighting is maintained, ensuring the dog's color and material properties remain uniform across views. The dog maintains a uniform and relaxed pose, occupying 60-80% of each sub-image frame without variations in scale. A completely pure white background is used, devoid of shadows or other visual distractions, providing clarity and focus necessary for accurate texture and geometric capture.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a dog captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the dog from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The dog is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will consist of a 4x4 grid, each cell containing a distinct, photorealistic view of a dog. These views serve to capture comprehensive angles necessary for precise 3D reconstruction, featuring front, back, side, top, bottom, and unique oblique perspectives. The consistency in lighting, color, and size across all images ensures accurate modeling, while the pure white background enhances detail clarity and focus. This systematic approach to capturing the dog's appearance from multiple angles provides comprehensive data for constructing a detailed 3D representation.",
