The dog will be captured from angles including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and multiple oblique viewpoints. Consistent photorealistic style, color, and material are maintained across all images, with consistent lighting conditions and a uniform pose. Each sub-image will maintain the dog within 60-80% of the frame, all against a pure white background with no distractive elements such as text, shadows, or grid lines.",
