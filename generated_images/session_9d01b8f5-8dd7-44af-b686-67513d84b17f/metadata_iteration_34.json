  "generation_metadata": "The image is designed to feature a 4x4 grid containing 16 distinct, photorealistic views of a dog for facilitating accurate 3D reconstruction. Each view captures the dog from specific angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and distinct oblique angles to ensure comprehensive coverage. Uniform lighting across all views is essential to maintain color consistency and material properties. Each sub-image showcases the dog centered and occupying 60-80% of the frame in a standardized relaxed pose. The background is pure white, free from shadows or other distractions, optimized for extracting detailed textures and geometric features necessary for accurate 3D modeling.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a dog captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the dog from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The dog is meticulously centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background must be a pure white with absolutely no shadows, text, or other objects, optimized for effective 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will showcase a precise 4x4 grid, where each of the 16 cells presents a distinct and photorealistic view of a dog, crafted specifically for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The arrangement includes key angles such as front, back, sides, top, bottom, and unique oblique perspectives to ensure full spatial coverage. Uniformity in lighting, color, and size across all images aids in achieving accurate 3D modeling. The pure white background enhances focus on intricate details, facilitating precise texture and geometric data capture.
