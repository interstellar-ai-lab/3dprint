  "generation_metadata": "The image should consist of a photorealistic dog captured in 16 distinct views arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each view must accurately represent the necessary angles: front, back, left, right, true top, true bottom, and a series of varied oblique angles for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The dog should maintain a consistent pose, size, fur texture, and color across all views. Uniform, neutral lighting is essential across all images to ensure the preservation of natural fur qualities without shadows or glare. The background should remain pure white, without any text, grid lines, or other elements, to keep the focus solely on the dog. Geometric constraints should be observed to maintain accurate proportion and scale, preventing distortion in the 3D model.",
