  "generation_metadata": "The revised image should feature a precise 4x4 grid comprising 16 photorealistic views of a single dog prepared for 3D reconstruction. Each view must capture the dog from unique angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and distinct diagonal/oblique perspectives for full spatial coverage. Consistency in the dog's pose across all images is crucial. The image must depict the dog in a neutral, relaxed posture and occupy 60-80% of the frame to maintain scale accuracy. The lighting needs to be uniform and soft, ensuring color and detail consistency across all views. The background is strictly pure white with no shadows, text, or any other objects to ensure a distraction-free setting essential for capturing accurate geometric data for modeling.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid, each displaying a dog captured from unique perspectives covering the full 360\u00b0 horizontally and vertical angles including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique views. The dog is consistently positioned at the center of each sub-image, with soft, uniform lighting to preserve texture details. The dog should appear in the same relaxed pose in each view, occupying 60-80% of each square. The background must be plain white, absolutely devoid of any shadows, text, or other objects, ensuring all images are apt for precise 3D model reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will present a structured 4x4 grid containing 16 distinct, consistent, and photorealistic views of a single dog, optimized for 3D reconstruction purposes. Each cell within the grid captures the dog from different specific angles, ensuring full coverage essential for 3D modeling: front, back, sides, top, bottom, and a diverse array of oblique views. The dog's pose remains identical throughout, highlighted against a pure white background with stable, soft lighting, enhancing depth and detail retention. This visual dataset supports an elaborate 3D modeling process, providing essential texture and geometric data without distraction.",
