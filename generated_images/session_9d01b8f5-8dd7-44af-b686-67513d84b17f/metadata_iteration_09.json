  "generation_metadata": "The image needs to depict a photorealistic dog captured in 16 distinct views arranged within a 4x4 grid. Each view should represent angles including the front, back, left, right, exact top, exact bottom, and multiple oblique angles to cover all aspects comprehensively necessary for precise 3D reconstruction. The dog must maintain a consistent pose, size, fur texture, and color across all 16 views to ensure pose consistency and uniform modeling inputs. Lighting must be uniform across all images, preserving the natural qualities of the dog's fur without variation. The background of each image should be pure white and devoid of any shadows, text, grid lines, or other objects to ensure full focus on the dog for accurate 3D model generation. Distinct angles should be clearly recognizable to provide a comprehensive 360-degree visual dataset.",
