  "generation_metadata": "The image needs to depict a photorealistic dog captured in 16 distinct views arranged within a 4x4 grid. Each view should represent angles including the front, back, left, right, exact top, exact bottom, and multiple oblique angles to cover all aspects comprehensively necessary for precise 3D reconstruction. The dog must maintain a consistent pose, size, fur texture, and color across all 16 views to ensure pose consistency and uniform modeling inputs. Uniform neutral lighting should be applied across all images to preserve natural fur qualities without introducing shadows or glare. The background must remain pure white, entirely devoid of text, grid lines, or other elements. Geometric constraints need to be maintained to assure accurate proportion and scale of the dog to prevent distortion in 3D rendering.",
