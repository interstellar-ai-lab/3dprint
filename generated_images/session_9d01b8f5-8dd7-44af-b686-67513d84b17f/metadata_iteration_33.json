  "generation_metadata": "The image is precisely composed to feature a 4x4 grid with 16 distinct, photorealistic views of a dog, aimed at enhancing the quality of 3D reconstruction. Each view captures the dog from specific angles including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and a variety of clearly distinct oblique angles, with no redundant perspectives. It ensures uniform lighting to retain the dog's color consistency and material properties across all views. Each sub-image showcases the dog centered and occupying 60-80% of the frame, maintaining a standardized relaxed pose throughout. The background is a completely pure white, free from shadows or distractions, optimized for extracting detailed textures and geometric features necessary for accurate reconstruction.",

Each sub-image shows the dog from a specific and distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and multiple clearly distinct oblique angles. The dog is consistently centered, occupying 60-80% of each view, maintaining uniform lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is entirely pure white with no shadows, text, lines, or other objects, ideal for 3D reconstruction.",
