  "generation_metadata": "The image should feature a photorealistic dog captured in 16 distinct views arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each view must clearly represent angles including the front, back, left, right, exact top, exact bottom, and multiple oblique angles for a comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The dog should maintain a consistent pose, size, fur texture, and color across all 16 views to ensure accurate 3D modeling inputs. Uniform, neutral lighting should be applied to preserve fur texture and natural coloration without causing shadows or glare. The background needs to remain pure white, devoid of any text, grid lines, or objects to keep the focus solely on the dog. Geometric constraints should ensure accurate proportions and scale of the dog, preventing distortion in the 3D output.",

Each sub-image shows the dog from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, exact top, exact bottom, and various oblique angles. The dog is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will present a dog in 16 unique perspectives organized within a 4x4 grid, crucial for comprehensive 3D model creation. Each perspective captures vital angles needed for full 360-degree coverage, including the essential top and bottom views.
