  "generation_metadata": "The image should feature a 4x4 grid of 16 photorealistic views of the same dog for 3D reconstruction. Each view should capture the dog from distinct angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The dog should be centered in each image, occupying 60-80% of the frame, maintaining a consistent, relaxed pose in all views. Lighting must be soft and uniform across all images to preserve texture details and color consistency. The background must be pure white with no shadows or overlays to avoid distractions, ensuring the image's suitability for extracting geometric data necessary for accurate 3D modeling.",

Each sub-image shows the dog from a unique viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The dog is centered in each view, with soft, uniform lighting, consistent scale (occupying 60-80% of each square), and identical positioning. The background is a pure white, completely devoid of shadows or any other objects, optimized for 3D reconstruction purposes.",
  "description": "This image will consist of a 4x4 grid where each of the 16 squares presents a distinct, photorealistic view of a single dog. The chosen angles include front, back, both sides, top, bottom, and various oblique perspectives to ensure complete spatial coverage necessary for 3D reconstruction. Consistent lighting, a relaxed pose held uniformly across all views, and a pure white background enhance the focus on capturing detailed textures and geometric features. This structured approach supports an accurate and comprehensive 3D modeling process by providing a data set that minimizes distractions and focuses on capturing the essential visual information required for reconstruction.",
