  "generation_metadata": "The image should comprise a 4x4 grid with 16 distinct, photorealistic views of a single dog to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction. Each view captures the dog from specific angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and a variety of distinct oblique angles. High consistency in lighting is crucial to maintain uniformity in color and material properties across all views. Each image must feature the dog centered and occupying 60-80% of the frame in an identical, relaxed pose throughout. The background must be pure white with no shadows or other distractions, enhancing texture and geometric feature extraction needed for precise 3D modeling.",

Each sub-image shows the dog from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and unique oblique angles. The dog is consistently centered, occupying 60-80% of each view with identical lighting, scale, and positioning.
