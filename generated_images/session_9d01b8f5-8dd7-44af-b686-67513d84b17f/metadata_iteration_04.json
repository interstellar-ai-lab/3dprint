Each view will capture the dog from specific angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles to ensure complete 360-degree coverage. The dog will rest in the same pose across all views with consistent lighting and a pure white background free from shadows and text. Precise details on fur texture and color consistency must be maintained throughout, with no variations in size or posture across the images. This setup is critical to enable accurate 3D reconstruction.",
