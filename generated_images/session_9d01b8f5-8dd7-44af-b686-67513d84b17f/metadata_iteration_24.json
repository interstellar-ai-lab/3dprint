  "generation_metadata": "This image will feature a photorealistic dog in 16 unique views arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each view is vital for thorough 3D reconstruction, covering the dog from several distinct angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, and intermediate angles. The pose of the dog will remain consistent in every image. A uniform lighting setup ensures no shadows, enhancing clarity and detail across all views. The dog's fur texture and color are uniform throughout all pictures. The background is pure white, devoid of any text, lines, or extraneous elements, to ensure accurate 3D modeling.",

Each photo has the dog centered with consistent pose, scale, and uniform lighting conditions throughout. The background must be absolutely pure white, without any shadows, text, grid lines, or overlays, facilitating perfect 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will present a comprehensive series of 16 photorealistic views of a dog organized in a 4x4 grid, ideal for detailed 3D reconstruction. This format captures all necessary orthogonal and oblique angles, promising a complete 360-degree visual coverage. Homogeneous lighting, coupled with the absence of shadows and a pure white background with a consistent pose across all photos, ensures the accuracy and precision needed to reconstruct the dog's features faithfully in three dimensions.",
