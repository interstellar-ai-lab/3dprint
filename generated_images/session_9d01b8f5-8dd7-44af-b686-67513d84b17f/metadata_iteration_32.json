  "generation_metadata": "The image is meticulously designed to feature a 4x4 grid containing 16 distinct, photorealistic views of a dog to facilitate 3D reconstruction. Each view captures the dog from highly specific angles: including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and a variety of clearly distinct oblique angles. The focus is on maintaining uniform lighting across all views to preserve the dog's color consistency and material properties. The dog's pose is standardized and relaxed, ensuring that it occupies 60-80% of each sub-image frame. Crucially, the background is completely pure white, devoid of any shadows or other distractions, which is essential for isolating the dog to capture detailed textures and geometric features accurately for reconstruction purposes.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a precise 4x4 grid featuring a dog captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the dog from a specific and distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and a variety of clearly different oblique angles. The dog is consistently centered in each view, maintaining uniform lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is entirely pure white with no shadows, text, lines, or other objects, making them ideal for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will consist of a flawless 4x4 grid, each cell presenting a distinct, photorealistic view of a dog, designed explicitly for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. These views include front, back, side, top, bottom, and various unique oblique perspectives to ensure complete coverage and accuracy. The uniformity in lighting, color, and size across all images optimizes them for accurate 3D modeling. Enhancing detail focus, the pure white background removes any visual barriers, promoting precise texture and geometric data capture. This structured assembly offers a robust framework for constructing an accurate 3D model.",
