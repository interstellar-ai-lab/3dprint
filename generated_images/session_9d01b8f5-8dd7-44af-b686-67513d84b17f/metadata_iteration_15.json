  "generation_metadata": "The image should consist of a photorealistic dog captured in 16 distinct views arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each view must accurately represent the necessary angles: front, back, left, right, true top, true bottom, and a series of varied oblique angles for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The dog should maintain a consistent pose, size, fur texture, and color across all views. Uniform, neutral lighting is essential across all images to ensure the preservation of natural fur qualities without shadows or glare. The background should remain pure white, without any text, grid lines, or other elements, to keep the focus solely on the dog. Geometric constraints should be observed to maintain accurate proportions and scale, preventing distortion in the 3D model.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a photorealistic dog captured from various angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and a variety of oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, and back-right. Each of the 16 individual views maintains the dog in an identical genetic pose and size, with uniform lighting and centered composition. The background is pure white without any gradients, grid lines, or text, ensuring a clear focus on the dog. These views support comprehensive 3D reconstruction by providing uniform image quality and angle diversity.",
