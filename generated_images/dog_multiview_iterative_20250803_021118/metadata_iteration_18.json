  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for effective 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following guidelines to ensure high quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure the exact same dog is used in all 16 images, maintaining absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Consistently capture the dog's unique features to ensure clear and accurate identification across all images.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images within a precise 4x4 grid, ensuring each square is equal in size and clearly defined to facilitate easy comparison and analysis of each view.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Capture a comprehensive range of angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal views to fully represent the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Each angle should be purposefully chosen to offer unique insights into the dog's features for effective modeling.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution and sharply detailed images with balanced and consistent lighting to clearly highlight the dog's features across all views.\n   - Avoid blurring, underexposure, or overexposure to maximize detail visibility and image quality.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a uniform white background in all images to ensure the dog remains the primary focus and to facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled and consistent lighting to maintain an even background appearance, eliminating variations and ensuring uniformity.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square to ensure a balanced and uniform grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Utilize a stable camera setup and consistent studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality assurance checks after capturing the images to confirm all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nAdhering to these guidelines will enhance the multiview image set's suitability for precise and effective 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image set fails to display the exact same dog across all 16 squares, which is crucial for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency detracts from the set's utility for accurate modeling. The grid layout is effectively organized, with each square clearly defined and of equal size, which aids in the analysis of individual views. The diversity of angles is adequate, providing a variety of perspectives necessary for detailed modeling, albeit undermined by the lack of consistency. The images are clear, sharp, and well-lit, enhancing the visibility of details. There are slight variations in background lighting that should be improved to ensure complete uniformity across images.",
