  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for achieving high-quality 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure optimal consistency and clarity:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture all 16 images using the exact same dog, ensuring absolute uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Pay close attention to the dog's unique features and characteristics across all images to maintain consistent identification.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Organize the images in a precise 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly defined, allowing for straightforward comparative analysis of the different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a comprehensive range of viewing angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal perspectives, to fully capture and represent the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Ensure each angle is strategically chosen to provide the most detailed and useful information for reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Capture high-resolution, sharp images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features. Avoid any blurriness or improper exposure.\n   - Ensure the clarity and quality of images are consistent across all angles to facilitate detailed visualization.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background to all images, maintaining focus solely on the dog to facilitate easy segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Utilize controlled and consistent lighting to ensure an even appearance of the background across all images, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally within each square to achieve a balanced and symmetrical layout.\n- Use a stable camera setup and consistent studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct thorough quality control checks post-capture to verify that all requirements for image consistency and quality are satisfied before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these comprehensive guidelines, the resulting multiview image set will be more suitable for accurate and reliable 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to consistently display the same dog across all 16 images, which is critical for successful 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly reduces the image set's suitability for modeling purposes. The grid layout is well-structured, providing clearly defined and equal-sized squares that aid in viewing and comparing each perspective. The variety of angles captured is satisfactory, offering multiple perspectives needed for comprehensive modeling. Image clarity is commendable, with sharp, well-lit photos maximizing detail visibility. There are slight variations in background consistency that should be addressed to ensure a uniform appearance across all images.",
