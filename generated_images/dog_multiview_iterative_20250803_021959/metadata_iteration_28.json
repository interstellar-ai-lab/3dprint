  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image displaying 16 different views of the SAME dog, arranged in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is essential for precise 3D reconstruction and must adhere to the following detailed guidelines to ensure consistency and high quality:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Capture the exact same dog in all 16 images, ensuring uniformity in breed, color, markings, and size.\n   - Focus on capturing the dog's unique features consistently across all views to facilitate precise and accurate 3D modeling.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images in a clearly defined 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly separated to facilitate straightforward comparison and analysis.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Offer a comprehensive range of viewing angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonals, to fully represent the dog's three-dimensional form.\n   - Select angles that provide diverse insights into the dog's anatomy to enhance the reliability of the reconstruction.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Use high-resolution and sharply detailed images with balanced and consistent lighting to thoroughly highlight the dog\u2019s features.\n   - Avoid blurring or improper exposure to maintain excellent detail visibility across all images.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Employ a consistent white background throughout all images to maintain the dog's prominence and to facilitate easy segmentation during 3D reconstruction.\n   - Utilize consistent lighting across all images to ensure an evenly lit background, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Center the dog in each square for a balanced and symmetrical grid presentation, optimizing focus and detail analysis.\n- Use a stable camera setup and standardized studio lighting to maintain uniformity throughout the entire photo shoot.\n- Conduct comprehensive quality checks post-capture to ensure all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy following these guidelines, the multiview image set will better meet the requirements for effective and precise 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The image set fails to display the exact same dog consistently across all 16 squares, a critical requirement for effective 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency significantly impacts the set's suitability for accurate modeling. However, the grid layout is well-structured with clearly defined and equal-sized squares, facilitating easy comparison. The angles provide a variety of perspectives necessary for 3D modeling, but this advantage is negated by inconsistency in the subject. The images exhibit impressive clarity, being sharp and well-lit, which enhances the visibility of details. Minor inconsistencies in background lighting should be addressed to ensure complete uniformity across all images.",
