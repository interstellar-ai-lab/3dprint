Each of the 16 squares should display the same dog viewed from a uniquely distinct angle to maximize angle diversity. Ensure the angles include a wide range of perspectives\u2014front, back, both sides, top, bottom, and angled shots from varying elevations. The dog should be posed naturally and consistently across all views to maintain subject uniformity. The images must be sharp, well-lit, and have a high resolution to capture intricate details. Use a plain, consistent white background across all views to focus attention entirely on the dog. Ensure lighting is even and shadows are minimized for optimal clarity and background consistency.",
