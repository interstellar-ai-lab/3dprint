  "prompt": "**Improved Image Generation Prompt:**\n\nCreate a single composite image featuring 16 distinct views of the SAME dog, organized in a 4x4 grid layout. This image set is crucial for accurate 3D reconstruction, so it must adhere to the following guidelines for optimal quality and consistency:\n\n1. **Dog Consistency:**\n   - Ensure that all 16 images capture the exact same dog, with no variations in breed, color, markings, or size.\n   - Focus on capturing and maintaining unique features of the dog consistently across all views to ensure identification continuity.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Arrange the images within a precise 4x4 grid, with each square being equal in size and clearly defined to allow for easy comparison and analysis of the different views.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Provide a diverse range of viewing angles, including front, back, sides, and diagonal perspectives, to fully capture the three-dimensional form of the dog.\n   - Ensure each angle is deliberate and provides a unique aspect of the dog\u2019s anatomy.\n\n4. **Image Clarity:**\n   - Utilize high-resolution, sharply detailed images with balanced lighting to highlight the dog's features and prevent any loss of detail.\n   - Avoid issues such as blurring or improper exposure to maximize visual clarity.\n\n5. **Background Consistency:**\n   - Apply a uniform white background to all images to maintain the focus on the dog and facilitate seamless segmentation during reconstruction.\n   - Use consistent lighting to ensure the background remains even across all images, eliminating any discrepancies.\n\n**Additional Instructions:**\n\n- Position the dog centrally in each square to maintain a balanced and symmetrical grid layout.\n- Use a stable camera setup and consistent lighting equipment to ensure uniformity throughout the photo shoot.\n- Conduct rigorous quality checks post-capture to verify that all criteria for consistency and quality are met before finalizing the image set.\n\nBy adhering to these guidelines, the resulting multiview image will be more suitable for precise and accurate 3D reconstruction.",

  "feedback": "The multiview image fails to depict the same dog consistently across all 16 squares, which is essential for reliable 3D reconstruction. This inconsistency severely impacts the suitability of the image set for 3D modeling. The grid layout is well-structured, allowing each view to be clearly defined and equal in size. The variety of angles is adequate, offering multiple perspectives necessary for an accurate 3D model. The images display excellent clarity, exhibiting sharpness and proper lighting, which is beneficial for observing detailed features. Despite this, minor variations in background lighting should be adjusted to ensure complete uniformity across the images.",
