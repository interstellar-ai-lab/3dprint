# Evaluation Agent Improvements

## Issues Identified and Fixed

Based on the image analysis, the evaluation agent was not working properly due to several issues:

### üîç **Problems Found in Generated Images**

1. **Multiple objects per cell** - Several cells had 2-3 objects instead of 1
2. **Mixed object types** - Cars, motorcycles, and circular objects instead of consistent object type
3. **Wireframe/low-poly style** - Some objects had wireframe overlays
4. **Text watermarks** - "Visual Stu" watermark in one cell
5. **Grid lines** - Black grid lines instead of clean white background
6. **Inconsistent poses** - Not 25 distinct angles of the same object

### üõ†Ô∏è **Improvements Made**

#### 1. **Enhanced Generation Prompt**

**Before:**
```python
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 3D CAD RECONSTRUCTION:
1. **5x5 Grid Layout**: Create exactly 25 squares arranged in a 5x5 grid
2. **One Object Per Square**: Each square must contain exactly ONE instance of the object
# ... basic requirements
```

**After:**
```python
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR 3D CAD RECONSTRUCTION (MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY):
1. **5x5 Grid Layout**: Create exactly 25 squares arranged in a 5x5 grid (5 rows √ó 5 columns)
2. **One Object Per Square**: Each square MUST contain exactly ONE instance of the object - NO EXCEPTIONS
3. **Same Object Type**: ALL 25 squares must show the SAME object type (e.g., if it's a car, all 25 must be cars, not mix of cars and motorcycles)
4. **Same Pose**: The object must be in the SAME pose/position across all 25 views
5. **25 Distinct Angles**: Each square must show a DIFFERENT angle/view of the object
6. **Consistent Size**: The object must appear the same size in all 25 squares
7. **Clean Background**: PURE WHITE background with NO grid lines, NO text, NO numbers, NO watermarks
8. **Realistic Style**: Photorealistic or realistic rendering, NOT wireframe, NOT low-poly, NOT 3D model style

CRITICAL FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID:
- Multiple objects in any square
- Mix of different object types (e.g., cars and motorcycles)
- Wireframe or low-poly rendering style
- Grid lines or text on the background
- Watermarks or logos
- Inconsistent object sizes
- Wrong grid size (must be exactly 5x5)
```

#### 2. **Improved Evaluation Criteria**

**Before:**
```python
CRITICAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS (BE VERY STRICT):
1. **Grid Layout**: Count the exact number of squares - it MUST be exactly 25 squares in a 5x5 grid
2. **Object Count**: Each square MUST contain exactly ONE object
# ... basic requirements
```

**After:**
```python
CRITICAL EVALUATION REQUIREMENTS (BE VERY STRICT):
1. **Grid Layout**: Count the exact number of squares - it MUST be exactly 25 squares in a 5x5 grid (5 rows √ó 5 columns)
2. **Object Count**: Each square MUST contain exactly ONE object - if any square has multiple objects, this is a MAJOR FAILURE
3. **Object Type Consistency**: ALL 25 squares must show the SAME object type (e.g., if it's a car, all 25 must be cars, not mix of cars and motorcycles)
4. **Background**: MUST be pure white or transparent - NO grid lines, NO text, NO numbers, NO watermarks, NO gray backgrounds
5. **Style**: MUST be photorealistic/realistic - NOT wireframe, NOT low-poly, NOT 3D model style
6. **Pose Consistency**: The object MUST be in the SAME pose across all 25 views
7. **Size Consistency**: The object MUST appear the same size in all 25 squares
8. **Angle Diversity**: Each square MUST show a DIFFERENT angle/view of the object

VISUAL INSPECTION CHECKLIST:
- Count the exact number of grid cells (should be 25)
- Check each cell for object count (should be exactly 1 per cell)
- Verify all objects are the same type
- Look for grid lines, text, or watermarks on background
- Check for wireframe or low-poly rendering effects
- Verify pose consistency across all views
- Check size consistency across all cells
```

#### 3. **Enhanced Feedback Loop**

**Before:**
```python
prompt = f"""
Please refine the generation results based on the following suggestions for improvement: {parsed_evaluation["suggestions_for_improvement"]}.
"""
```

**After:**
```python
prompt = f"""
EVALUATION FEEDBACK:
- Image Quality: {parsed_evaluation["scores"]["image_quality"]}/10
- Metadata Accuracy: {parsed_evaluation["scores"]["metadata_accuracy"]}/10  
- Completeness: {parsed_evaluation["scores"]["completeness"]}/10

SPECIFIC ISSUES TO FIX:
{parsed_evaluation["suggestions_for_improvement"]}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS (MUST BE FOLLOWED EXACTLY):
1. **5x5 Grid Layout**: Create exactly 25 squares arranged in a 5x5 grid (5 rows √ó 5 columns)
2. **One Object Per Square**: Each square MUST contain exactly ONE instance of the object - NO EXCEPTIONS
3. **Same Object Type**: ALL 25 squares must show the SAME object type (e.g., if it's a car, all 25 must be cars, not mix of cars and motorcycles)
# ... all requirements repeated

CRITICAL FAILURE POINTS TO AVOID:
- Multiple objects in any square
- Mix of different object types (e.g., cars and motorcycles)
- Wireframe or low-poly rendering style
- Grid lines or text on the background
- Watermarks or logos
- Inconsistent object sizes
- Wrong grid size (must be exactly 5x5)

Create an improved version that specifically addresses the issues identified in the evaluation.

```

#### 4. **Enhanced Failure Detection**

**Before:**
```python
failure_indicators = [
    "4x4", "16 views", "16 squares", "wrong grid", "not 5x5",
    "multiple objects", "stacked", "overlapping", "three cars",
    "grid pattern", "text labels", "numbers", "gray background",
    "wireframe", "low-poly", "3d model style", "toy-like"
]
```

**After:**
```python
failure_indicators = [
    "4x4", "16 views", "16 squares", "wrong grid", "not 5x5",
    "multiple objects", "stacked", "overlapping", "three cars", "two cars",
    "grid pattern", "text labels", "numbers", "gray background",
    "wireframe", "low-poly", "3d model style", "toy-like",
    "watermark", "visual stu", "grid lines", "black lines",
    "different object types", "mix of", "cars and motorcycles",
    "circular objects", "multiple motorcycles"
]
```

## Files Updated

1. **`test_evaluation_multi_view.py`** - Main evaluation script with improvements
2. **`test_improved_evaluation.py`** - Standalone test for improved evaluation
3. **`VISUAL_EVALUATION_GUIDE.md`** - Guide for visual evaluation implementation

## Key Improvements Summary

### üéØ **More Specific Requirements**
- Added explicit "Same Object Type" requirement
- Emphasized "NO EXCEPTIONS" for critical rules
- Added specific failure points to avoid

### üîç **Better Visual Inspection**
- Added detailed visual inspection checklist
- Enhanced failure detection patterns
- More specific evaluation criteria

### üìù **Improved Feedback Loop**
- More detailed feedback with specific issues
- Repeated critical requirements in feedback
- Clear failure points to address

### üõ°Ô∏è **Robust Error Handling**
- Enhanced failure indicator detection
- Better score parsing with fallbacks
- More comprehensive error handling

## Testing the Improvements

Use the new test script to verify the improvements:

```bash
python test_improved_evaluation.py
```

This will test the evaluation agent with the specific issues identified in the problematic image and should now properly detect:

- Multiple objects per cell
- Mixed object types (cars + motorcycles)
- Wireframe/low-poly rendering
- Text watermarks
- Grid lines on background
- Inconsistent poses

The evaluation agent should now give appropriate low scores (1-3) for these issues and provide specific feedback for improvement.
