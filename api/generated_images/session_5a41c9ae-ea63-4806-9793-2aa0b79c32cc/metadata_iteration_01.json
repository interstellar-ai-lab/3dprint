  "target_object": "a sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "The sport car is a sleek, modern design with a low profile, aerodynamic curves, and a glossy metallic red finish. It features a distinct, aggressive front grille, LED headlights, and wide tires with alloy rims. The car's body has an elegant yet sporty silhouette with a prominent rear spoiler and dual exhaust pipes. The interior is visible through tinted windows, showcasing a high-tech dashboard and leather seats. The lighting is consistent across all images, ensuring no reflections or shadows interfere with the pure white background. The car is centered in each view, and the scale is uniform across all images. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views, learning from 0 previous iterations.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.",
  "description": "This image set provides a comprehensive 360-degree view of a sport car, ensuring consistent detailing and lighting across all 16 perspectives. This setup is ideal for 3D reconstruction as it covers all possible viewing angles, maintaining identical object properties in each image. The pure white background and absence of shadows or additional elements ensure clear and unobstructed views of the car, facilitating accurate 3D modeling.",
