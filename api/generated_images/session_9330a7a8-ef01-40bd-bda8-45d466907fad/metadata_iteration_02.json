  "target_object": "a modern sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "The image should feature a modern sport car with sleek, aerodynamic lines and a futuristic design. Ensure the car is depicted with consistent lighting across all images to avoid any overexposure or uneven shadows. The car should be centered in each of the 16 views, which should include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, elevated front, elevated back, elevated left, elevated right, side view from a downward angle, and side view from an upward angle. The background must be pure white with no shadows or objects, providing a clean, distraction-free environment suitable for 3D reconstruction. The car's design features, such as its grill, headlights, side mirrors, and rear spoiler, should be clearly visible and uniformly detailed across all angles.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a 4x4 grid image of a modern sport car, showcasing 16 distinct angles. Ensure each sub-image presents the car from a unique perspective: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car must be perfectly centered in each view with consistent lighting, avoiding overexposure or shadows. Utilize a pure white background for a clean, artifact-free presentation. The car should feature sleek, aerodynamic lines and a futuristic design, with clear detailing on the grill, headlights, side mirrors, and rear spoiler. This setup is intended for 3D reconstruction, so maintain uniform scale, position, and detailing across all views. Specifically address any previous issues by ensuring the grid layout is perfectly adhered to, with no deviation from the 4x4 structure, and that each angle is distinct and covers all necessary perspectives.",
  "description": "The generated image provides a comprehensive 4x4 grid of a modern sport car, captured from 16 different angles. This setup ensures complete coverage for 3D reconstruction, addressing previous feedback by correcting grid layout issues and ensuring consistent lighting and centering. The car is presented against a pure white background, eliminating distractions and improving image quality. Specific design features are clearly visible, enhancing metadata accuracy and facilitating detailed 3D modeling.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 6/10\n- The images are generally clear, but there are noticeable inconsistencies in lighting and focus. Some views appear slightly blurred, and there are compression artifacts present.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 7/10\n- The images mostly match the description of a modern sports car, but there are minor discrepancies in the design details that could affect reconstruction accuracy.\n\nCompleteness: 5/10\n- While the grid is complete, the angles are not distinct enough across all views. Several angles are too similar, and some important perspectives are missing.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and reflections that can distort the 3D reconstruction.\n- Increase the resolution to reduce compression artifacts and improve clarity.\n- Adjust focus to ensure all parts of the car are sharp and clear.\n- Capture more distinct angles, especially focusing on underrepresented perspectives like the top and bottom views.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Specify more detailed design elements of the car to ensure accurate representation.\n- Include instructions for consistent lighting and focus in the metadata.\n- Emphasize the need for a wider range of angles to improve 3D reconstruction potential.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The lighting inconsistency is a major flaw, affecting the overall quality.\n- The lack of distinctly different angles heavily penalizes the completeness score.\n- The presence of visual artifacts and slight blurring detracts from the image quality.\n- The background should be more neutral to avoid distracting elements.",
    "suggestions_for_improvement": "Scoring penalties applied: Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and reflections that can distort the 3D reconstruction. - Increase the resolution to reduce compression artifacts and improve clarity. - Adjust focus to ensure all parts of the car are sharp and clear. - Capture more distinct angles, especially focusing on underrepresented perspectives like the top and bottom views.",
    "metadata_suggestions": "- Specify more detailed design elements of the car to ensure accurate representation. - Include instructions for consistent lighting and focus in the metadata. - Emphasize the need for a wider range of angles to improve 3D reconstruction potential. Extremely Critical Evaluation Points: - The lighting inconsistency is a major flaw, affecting the overall quality. - The lack of distinctly different angles heavily penalizes the completeness score. - The presence of visual artifacts and slight blurring detracts from the image quality. - The background should be more neutral to avoid distracting elements.",
