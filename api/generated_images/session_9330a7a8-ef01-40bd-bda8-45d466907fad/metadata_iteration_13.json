  "target_object": "a modem sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "The object is a sleek, modern sports car with aerodynamic curves, a spoiler, and low-profile tires. The 16 views are organized in a 4x4 grid, including front, back, left, right, top, and bottom views, as well as various oblique angles from above and below. The lighting is uniform and diffused across all images to eliminate shadows and brightness variations. Each sub-image has high resolution to prevent compression artifacts, and the car is perfectly centered in each view to ensure focus and uniformity. The background is pure white with no artifacts, providing a clean and neutral setting suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a single image featuring a modern sports car in a 4x4 grid arrangement, showcasing 16 distinct angles. Ensure each view is taken from a unique perspective: straight front, straight back, left profile, right profile, top-down, bottom-up, and multiple diagonal angles from above and below the car. The car should be brightly illuminated with consistent, soft lighting in every image, eliminating any shadows or brightness inconsistencies. Use high resolution to ensure clarity and avoid compression artifacts. The car must be perfectly centered in each frame, maintaining a neutral white background without shadows or distractions. This setup is tailored for optimal 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image consists of 16 distinct photographic views of a modern sports car, organized into a 4x4 grid. Each perspective offers a unique angle, providing comprehensive coverage for 3D reconstruction. Improvements from previous iterations include consistent lighting across all images, increased resolution for clearer details, and a diverse range of angles to enhance reconstruction accuracy. The car is perfectly centered, and the background is a pure white, free from any artifacts, ensuring a clean and professional appearance.",
