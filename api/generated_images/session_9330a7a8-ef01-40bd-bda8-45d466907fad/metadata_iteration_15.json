  "target_object": "a modern sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "This set features a modern sport car captured in 16 distinct high-resolution images arranged in a 4x4 grid for optimal 3D reconstruction. Each image covers a unique angle, including front, back, both sides, top, bottom, and multiple oblique perspectives, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The lighting is uniform and bright to enhance clarity and detail, with each shot perfectly centered on the car. The background is a pure white, devoid of shadows or distractions. This setup adheres strictly to the feedback, ensuring all angles are distinct and the car is consistently positioned in all views.",
  "image_prompt": "Generate a high-resolution 4x4 grid of 16 distinct digital photographs of a modern sport car for 3D reconstruction. Each sub-image in the grid must depict the car from a unique angle: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles at 45 and 30 degrees. Ensure consistent, high-quality lighting across all images to improve clarity and focus, with no shadows or external objects. The car should be perfectly centered in each frame, with a pure white background to avoid any distractions. Enhance the resolution and sharpness of each photo to capture fine details accurately. This setup must address previous quality and completeness issues, ensuring no angle is repeated and all views are distinct.",
  "description": "The generated image is a 4x4 grid of 16 views of a modern sport car, designed to meet the specific requirements for 3D reconstruction. The improvements made include consistent high-quality lighting, increased image resolution, perfect centering of the car, and a completely neutral white background to eliminate distractions. Each angle is unique, providing comprehensive coverage necessary for accurate 3D modeling.",
