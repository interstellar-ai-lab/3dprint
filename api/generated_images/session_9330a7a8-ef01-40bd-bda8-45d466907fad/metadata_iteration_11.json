  "target_object": "a modern sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "This set consists of 16 high-resolution images of a modern sport car, each captured from a unique angle in a 4x4 grid layout. The angles include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique perspectives. The lighting is uniformly bright and neutral across all images to ensure consistent exposure and clarity, crucial for 3D reconstruction. The car's features, such as its aerodynamic curves, wheels, and headlights, are clearly defined and consistently represented in each view. The images maintain perfect focus and are free from motion blur, ensuring sharpness and detail. All views are centered with the car occupying a consistent scale and position, and the background is a pure white with no distracting shadows or artifacts.",
  "image_prompt": "A 4x4 grid of 16 high-resolution images, each depicting a modern sport car from a different angle. The angles include: direct front, direct back, left profile, right profile, top-down view, bottom-up view, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, and four additional unique oblique angles to ensure comprehensive coverage. The car is perfectly centered in each image, occupying about 75% of the frame. The lighting is consistent and evenly distributed, providing a neutral brightness without shadows to maintain exposure uniformity. The background is pure white, free from any artifacts or shadows. The car is in sharp focus with no blur, clearly depicting details such as the aerodynamic lines, wheels, and headlights. This setup addresses previous feedback by ensuring a variety of angles, consistent lighting, and image sharpness, all essential for accurate 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image is a comprehensive set of 16 views of a modern sport car, specifically designed to address previous feedback issues. It includes a diverse range of angles necessary for 3D reconstruction, with consistent lighting and clarity across all images. The car's features are uniformly represented, and the images are free from background noise. This enhanced image set is suitable for creating a detailed and accurate 3D model of the car.",
