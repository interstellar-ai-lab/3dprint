  "generation_metadata": "Detailed description of the object and the 16 views for 3D reconstruction, including specific angle descriptions, lighting specifications, material properties, and geometric constraints. MUST address the specific issues from previous feedback: Scoring penalties applied: Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. 1. **Increase View Variety:** Ensure a full 16-view grid with distinct angles, including side and top views, to capture all necessary details for reconstruction. 2. **Consistent Lighting:** Adjust lighting to be uniform across all images to prevent overexposure and shadow inconsistencies. 3. **Resolution and Clarity:** Enhance image resolution and reduce artifacts to improve detail clarity. 4. **Centering and Framing:** Ensure the car is perfectly centered in each frame with a consistent scale and distance.",
  "image_prompt": "Create a single image consisting of a 4x4 grid, each cell containing a high-resolution photograph of a modern sport car from a distinct viewpoint. The views should include: top-down, bottom-up, front, back, left side, right side, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, and various diagonal angles to ensure comprehensive coverage. Ensure the car is perfectly centered in each frame, maintaining a consistent scale and distance. The lighting should be even and neutral across all images to eliminate shadows and prevent overexposure. The background must be completely white with no artifacts or distractions. Each viewpoint should capture the car's details clearly, with high resolution to enhance clarity and reduce any visual artifacts, suitable for accurate 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image is a 4x4 grid featuring 16 distinct views of a modern sport car, designed for optimal use in 3D reconstruction. Each view is captured from a unique angle, including top, bottom, sides, front, back, and diagonals, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Uniform lighting and a pure white background enhance detail visibility and eliminate distractions. The improvements focus on view variety, lighting consistency, resolution clarity, and proper centering, addressing all previous feedback for enhanced reconstruction accuracy.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 5/10\n- The images show noticeable lighting inconsistencies across different views. Some images are overexposed, while others are underexposed, affecting the clarity and detail. There is also a slight blur in a few images, which reduces the overall sharpness.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 6/10\n- The images generally match the description of a modern sports car, but there are discrepancies in the car's features across different views. The metadata should specify consistent details for accuracy.\n\nCompleteness: 4/10\n- The coverage is inadequate for 3D reconstruction. The views are too similar, especially in the front and rear angles. There is a lack of side and top views, which are crucial for a complete reconstruction.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to maintain uniform exposure and clarity.\n- Increase the variety of angles, including side and top views, to provide a comprehensive set of images for 3D modeling.\n- Improve focus and reduce blur to enhance image sharpness.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Specify the need for diverse angles, including side and top views, in the metadata.\n- Include details about lighting conditions to ensure consistency across all images.\n- Clearly define the car's features to maintain uniformity in all views.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The 4x4 grid requirement is not met due to the lack of distinct angles.\n- Lighting inconsistencies are a major flaw, affecting the image quality.\n- The object is not perfectly centered in all views, which is essential for accurate reconstruction.\n- The background, while mostly neutral, shows some artifacts that should be eliminated.\n- Overall, the set needs significant improvement in variety, quality, and consistency to be suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
