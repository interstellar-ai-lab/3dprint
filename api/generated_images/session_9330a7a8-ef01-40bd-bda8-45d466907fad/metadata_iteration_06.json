  "target_object": "a modern sports car",
  "generation_metadata": "This generation focuses on creating a set of 16 images arranged in a precise 4x4 grid, each capturing a modern sports car from unique angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Consistent, even lighting is used across all images to eliminate reflections and shadows. The car is centered in each sub-image, maintaining the same scale and positioning. The background is pure white to prevent any distractions or artifacts, essential for high-quality 3D reconstruction. Special attention is given to ensuring high resolution and focus to capture fine details of the car's design, such as the curvature of its bodywork, the texture of its surfaces, and the detailing of its components.",
  "image_prompt": "Create a high-resolution image featuring a modern sports car, presented in a 4x4 grid layout. Each of the sixteen sub-images shows the car from distinct angles, including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique perspectives like front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. Ensure each view is labeled accurately to match these specified angles. The lighting must be perfectly consistent across all images, avoiding any distracting reflections or shadows. Capture the car with impeccable focus and resolution to highlight its intricate details, such as the contours of its body, wheel design, and any visible interior features. The background should be a pure white, devoid of any other objects or distractions, to provide a clean canvas suitable for 3D reconstruction purposes.",
  "description": "The generated image is a comprehensive set of 16 distinct views of a modern sports car, critical for 3D reconstruction. This iteration addresses previous feedback by ensuring consistent lighting, high resolution, and a neutral background. Each angle is clearly defined and labeled, providing a complete set of perspectives necessary to accurately reconstruct the car's geometry. The improvements made ensure no deviations from the 4x4 grid layout, eliminating any previous issues with lighting inconsistencies, reflections, and incorrect labeling, thus enhancing the utility of the image set for reconstruction tasks.",
