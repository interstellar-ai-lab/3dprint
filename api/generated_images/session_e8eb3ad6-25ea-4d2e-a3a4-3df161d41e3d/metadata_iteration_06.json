  "generation_metadata": "Detailed description of the object and the 16 views for 3D reconstruction, including specific angle descriptions, lighting specifications, material properties, and geometric constraints. MUST address the specific issues from previous feedback: Scoring penalties applied: Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to enhance clarity and focus. - Increase the variety of angles, including top, bottom, and more oblique views, to provide a comprehensive 360-degree perspective. - Maintain a perfectly neutral background to avoid distractions and enhance object focus. - Ensure the dog is perfectly centered in each image to maintain consistency. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen high-resolution digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring the EXACT SAME cute dog captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images shows the IDENTICAL cute dog from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The cute dog, a small breed with fluffy fur, is centered in each view, with consistent lighting and focus. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction. Ensure all images have the same size, scale, and positioning for enhanced clarity and focus.",
  "description": "This generated image contains a 4x4 grid of 16 distinct views of the same cute dog, meticulously arranged to enhance 3D reconstruction capabilities. Each view provides a unique perspective, addressing previous feedback by ensuring consistent lighting, a neutral background, and a comprehensive range of angles. The object remains identical across all views, improving the set's utility for accurate 3D modeling.",

    "markdown_report": "**Image Quality: 6/10**  \nThe images are clear with decent lighting, but there are noticeable inconsistencies in focus and lighting across the grid. The resolution is acceptable, but not exceptional.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 5/10**  \nThe images match the target object, a cute dog, but the labeling is inconsistent and repetitive. The metadata does not accurately describe the distinct angles.\n\n**Completeness: 3/10**  \nThe coverage is poor. There are multiple repeated angles, and the grid lacks the required diversity. The primary angles are not all distinctly represented, and oblique angles are missing.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n- Ensure each image in the grid represents a distinctly different angle. Avoid repetition.\n- Improve lighting consistency across all images to maintain uniformity.\n- Enhance focus and resolution to achieve a sharper, more professional quality.\n- Ensure the dog is perfectly centered in each image with a clean, neutral background.\n\n**Metadata Suggestions:**  \n- Clearly label each angle to reflect its unique position (e.g., \"Front-Left Oblique\" instead of repeating \"Front\").\n- Include detailed descriptions of each view to ensure accurate metadata representation.\n\n**Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:**  \n- There is significant repetition in angles, with multiple images labeled the same.\n- The object consistency is acceptable, but the lack of angle diversity is a major flaw.\n- Lighting variations and focus inconsistencies detract from the overall quality.\n- The background, while neutral, could be improved for uniformity across images.",

    "previous_metadata_suggestions": "- Specify the need for a full 360-degree coverage, including all primary and oblique angles. - Emphasize the requirement for consistent lighting and focus across all images. - Include instructions for a neutral background and centered object to improve reconstruction quality. Extremely Critical Evaluation Points: - The lack of angle diversity is a major flaw, with many images showing similar front-facing views. - Lighting inconsistencies and slight blurring detract from the overall quality. - The absence of top and bottom views severely limits the set's usefulness for 3D reconstruction. - Object consistency is generally maintained, but the lack of angle variation is a critical issue."
