  "generation_metadata": "A detailed 4x4 grid of 16 images showcasing the exact same cute dog from distinctly different 3D angles for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Each image must maintain the dog's identical appearance, including size, shape, color, and texture. The angles include primary views (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and additional evenly distributed oblique views (e.g., front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Uniform lighting is critical to avoid overexposure or shadows. Each shot should be high-resolution and sharply focused. The dog must be centered in each image against a pure white background, free of shadows or artifacts, ensuring that all visual details remain consistent across views.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring the EXACT SAME cute dog captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images shows the IDENTICAL cute dog from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The cute dog is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: Ensure uniform lighting across all images to avoid overexposure or shadows that obscure details. Increase the resolution and ensure each image is sharply focused to capture fine details. Use accurate and consistent labeling for each angle to match the intended metadata. Capture all 16 distinct angles, including primary and oblique views, to cover the full 360-degree sphere. Make sure the dog is perfectly centered in each image to maintain consistency.",
  "description": "This image set is designed to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction of a cute dog, addressing previous feedback by ensuring uniform lighting, high resolution, and distinct angle coverage. Improvements include consistent object appearance across all views, distinct and labeled angles, and a neutral background to eliminate distractions. The set ensures all necessary perspectives are captured, aiding in comprehensive 3D modeling.",
