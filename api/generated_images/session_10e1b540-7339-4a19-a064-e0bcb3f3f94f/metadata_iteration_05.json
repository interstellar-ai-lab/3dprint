The views should include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles. Each sub-image must depict a distinct angle, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the car. Lighting must be consistent and even across all images, with no shadows or reflections. The car should appear centered and of the same scale in each sub-image. The background must be pure white with no grid lines or additional elements. The 4x4 grid layout is crucial for successful 3D reconstruction, requiring precise alignment and equal spacing between all sub-images. The vibrant red color of the car should be emphasized to ensure visibility and consistency. This iteration focuses on resolving previous issues related to lighting consistency, angle diversity, and grid layout, based on feedback from four previous iterations.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME vibrant red modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image is a 4x4 grid featuring 16 different views of the same vibrant red modern sport car, designed for effective 3D reconstruction.
