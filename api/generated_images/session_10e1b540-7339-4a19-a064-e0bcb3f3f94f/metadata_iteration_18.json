The 16 views must cover a complete 360-degree rotation, including primary views (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Lighting should be consistent across all views, ensuring no shadows or reflections on the pure white background. The car's material properties, such as its metallic shine and smooth texture, must be accurately depicted. The geometric constraints require the car to be centered in each sub-image, maintaining uniform size and scale across all angles. All views should be captured with consistent camera settings to ensure clarity and detail suitable for 3D reconstruction.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image consists of a modern sport car displayed in a 4x4 grid format, providing 16 unique angles for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Improvements include enhanced lighting consistency, diverse viewing angles, and precise grid alignment. This setup ensures detailed visualization of the car's features, aiding in accurate 3D modeling.\",\n    \"previous_iteration_metadata\": {\n        \"all_iterations\": 17,\n        \"latest_scores\": {\n            \"image_quality\": 0,\n            \"metadata_accuracy\": 0,\n            \"completeness\": 0\n        },\n        \"latest_suggestions\": \"Continue improving the generation\",\n        \"latest_metadata_suggestions\": \"Improve metadata with more specific details\",\n        \"historical_analysis\": \"\\n    \ud83e\udde0 INTELLIGENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT:\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83d\udcca PATTERN ANALYSIS:\\n    Score Progression: Iteration 1: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 2: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 3: 1.0 \u2192 Iteration 4: 1.7 \u2192 Iteration 5: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 6: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 7: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 8: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 9: 2.3 \u2192 Iteration 10: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 11: 1.7 \u2192 Iteration 12: 2.7 \u2192 Iteration 13: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 14: 1.0 \u2192 Iteration 15: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 16: 8.3 \u2192 Iteration 17: 0.0\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udd0d MOST CRITICAL ISSUES:\\n    lighting consistency (9 times), angle diversity (9 times), grid layout (9 times)\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udca1 RECOMMENDED FOCUS:\\n    lighting consistency, angle diversity\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83c\udfaf IMMEDIATE FOCUS (from most recent iteration):\\n    - Latest scores: {'image_quality':",
