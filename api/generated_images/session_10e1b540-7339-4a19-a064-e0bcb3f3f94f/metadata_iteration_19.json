Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction.

The quality of individual images might be high, but the lack of proper grid alignment is a major flaw.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 2/10**\n- **Issues**: The image does not match the intended 4x4 grid layout. The presence of multiple objects and angles not specified in the metadata is a significant discrepancy.\n\n**Completeness: 1/10**\n- **Issues**: The image lacks the required 16 distinct views. The absence of a complete 360-degree coverage makes it unsuitable for 3D reconstruction.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement\n\n1. **4x4 Grid Requirement**: Ensure the image is a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 sub-images. This is critical for 3D reconstruction.\n   \n2. **Angle Diversity**: Include all specified angles, ensuring each view is unique and covers the full 360-degree sphere.\n\n3. **Background Consistency**: Maintain a pure white background with no additional elements or shadows.\n\n4. **Object Consistency**: Ensure the car remains identical across all views with no variations in appearance.\n\n### Metadata Suggestions\n\n1. **Clarify Grid Layout**: Emphasize the necessity of a 4x4 grid in the prompt to avoid deviations.\n\n2. **Detail Angle Requirements**: Specify the exact angles needed, including primary and oblique views, to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n3. **Background and Object Consistency**: Reinforce the requirement for a pure white background and consistent object appearance.\n\nBy addressing these issues, future iterations can better align with the intended 3D reconstruction goals.",
