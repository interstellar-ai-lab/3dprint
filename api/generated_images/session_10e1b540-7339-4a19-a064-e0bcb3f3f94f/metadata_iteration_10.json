Each sub-image in the grid shows the identical car from a unique 3D viewpoint, covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The angles include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and ten additional oblique angles evenly distributed in 3D space. The car's appearance, details, and characteristics remain completely identical across all views; only the viewing angle changes. Lighting is consistent across all images, with the car centered in each view. The background is pure white, devoid of shadows, textures, patterns, or any distracting elements, ensuring that only the car is visible. This setup is designed specifically for accurate 3D reconstruction, addressing previous issues of lighting consistency, angle diversity, and grid layout. Lessons from 9 previous iterations have been incorporated to enhance image quality and metadata accuracy.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A perfect 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the exact same modem sport car captured from 16 distinctly different 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the identical modem sport car from a unique 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a completely different 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain completely identical across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: Only the modem sport car should be visible - no other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be completely pure white with no shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This must be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.
