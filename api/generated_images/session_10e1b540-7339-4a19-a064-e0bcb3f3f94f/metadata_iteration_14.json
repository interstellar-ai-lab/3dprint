Each view should present the car from a different angle, covering a full 360-degree range. The views include standard angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Consistent lighting is essential to avoid shadows and ensure uniformity across all images. The white background must be completely pure, with no additional elements or shadows. The object must remain identical in appearance and details across all views, focusing only on different 3D perspectives. This setup is designed to support accurate 3D reconstruction by providing diverse yet cohesive visual data.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A perfect 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modem sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modem sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modem sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"This generated image consists of a modem sport car displayed in 16 unique angles within a 4x4 grid, ensuring comprehensive coverage for 3D reconstruction.

Lighting consistency is not maintained, and there are noticeable artifacts and grid lines, which are not acceptable for 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 1/10**\n- The image does not match the intended metadata. It lacks the specified 4x4 grid of 16 distinct views. The presence of grid lines and other elements deviates significantly from the pure white background requirement.\n\n**Completeness: 1/10**\n- The coverage of different angles is inadequate. The image does not provide the required 16 unique 3D angles, and the presence of grid lines and other elements disrupts the completeness needed for 3D reconstruction.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- **4x4 Grid Requirement:** Ensure the image is a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 distinct sub-images. Each sub-image must be clearly separated and show a unique angle.\n- **Lighting Consistency:** Maintain consistent lighting across all views to avoid shadows and ensure uniformity.\n- **Background Cleanliness:** The background must be completely pure white with no additional elements, shadows, or grid lines.\n- **Angle Diversity:** Include all specified angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 oblique angles) to cover the full 360-degree sphere.\n- **Object Consistency:** The object must remain identical across all views, with no changes in appearance or details.\n\n### Metadata Suggestions:\n- Clearly specify the need for a pure white background and the exclusion of any grid lines or additional elements.\n- Emphasize the importance of maintaining consistent lighting and object appearance across all views.\n- Reinforce the requirement for 16 distinct angles, ensuring full coverage for 3D reconstruction.\n\n### Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The image fails to meet the critical 4x4 grid and clean background requirements, which are essential for 3D reconstruction.\n- The presence of grid lines and inconsistent object presentation are major flaws.\n- Immediate improvements are needed in grid layout, lighting, and angle diversity to meet the intended purpose.",
