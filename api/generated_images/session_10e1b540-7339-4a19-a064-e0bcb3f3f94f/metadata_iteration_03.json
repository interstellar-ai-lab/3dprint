These angles cover the complete 360-degree view of the car, including primary angles such as front, back, left, right, top, and bottom, along with 10 additional oblique angles (e.g., front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, and more). The car is consistently lit across all images to ensure clarity and quality. The background is a pure white with no shadows, textures, or other elements, ensuring the car appears to float in space suitable for 3D reconstruction. This iteration addresses critical issues from previous feedback, such as maintaining consistent lighting, ensuring angle diversity, and using a vibrant red color as specified.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"Generate a digital image of a modern sport car in a vibrant red color, arranged in a perfect 4x4 grid layout with 16 individual sub-images. Each sub-image should capture the exact same car from distinctly different 3D angles, covering the full 360-degree sphere. The angles must include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles evenly distributed around the 3D space. Ensure consistent lighting across all views to provide clear and detailed visuals. The background must be completely pure white with no additional elements, shadows, or textures, making the car appear to float in space. No grid lines, annotations, or text should be present.
