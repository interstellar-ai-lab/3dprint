Each sub-image will show the car from a unique 3D angle to facilitate comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The angles include the six primary views: front, back, left, right, top, and bottom, alongside ten additional oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. The lighting is consistent across all images to ensure uniformity and avoid shadows or gradients. The car maintains the same appearance, detailing, and proportions in all views, adhering to the requirement of object consistency. The background remains pure white, devoid of any visual distractions, ensuring the focus remains solely on the car.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modem sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modem sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modem sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image is a 4x4 grid of a modem sport car viewed from 16 different angles, suitable for 3D reconstruction.
