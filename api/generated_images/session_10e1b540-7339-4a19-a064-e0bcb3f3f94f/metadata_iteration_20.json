    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 4/10\n- The images lack clarity and consistency in lighting. There are noticeable reflections and shadows, which detract from the pure white background requirement. Some images appear overexposed.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 2/10\n- The image does not match the intended 4x4 grid layout. There are multiple objects and angles not specified in the metadata. The presence of interior shots deviates from the exterior angle requirement.\n\nCompleteness: 3/10\n- The coverage of different angles is poor. The intended 16 distinct exterior views are not present, and there are significant gaps in angle diversity. Interior shots take up space meant for exterior angles.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure the grid is a perfect 4x4 with 16 distinct exterior views of the car. Remove any interior shots and focus on the specified angles.\n- Maintain consistent lighting across all images to avoid reflections and shadows. The background must be pure white.\n- Each angle should be unique and cover the full 360-degree sphere around the car, including the specified primary and oblique angles.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Emphasize the necessity of exterior views only. Clarify that interior shots are not needed.\n- Reinforce the requirement for a pure white background and consistent lighting.\n- Specify that each image should focus on a different exterior angle, avoiding repetition or overlap.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The grid is not a proper 4x4 layout, and the inclusion of interior shots is a major deviation.\n- Lighting inconsistencies and reflections are significant flaws.\n- The object is not consistently presented across all views, with variations in angle coverage.\n- The presence of non-exterior views heavily penalizes the score.",
