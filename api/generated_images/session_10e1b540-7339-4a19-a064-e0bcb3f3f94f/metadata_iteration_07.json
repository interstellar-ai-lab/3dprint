The 16 views cover a full 360-degree range with precise attention to lighting consistency and angle diversity. The car must be depicted with a glossy metallic finish, reflecting light evenly across all views. The angles include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and ten oblique perspectives such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back. Each sub-image maintains the same scale and central positioning, with no additional objects or background elements. The background is a pure white, ensuring the car appears to float, suitable for 3D reconstruction. This iteration focuses on enhancing lighting consistency and angle diversity, addressing previous feedback issues.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modem sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modem sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modem sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"This image set features a modem sport car captured from 16 distinct angles, arranged in a 4x4 grid for optimal 3D reconstruction. The angles cover a complete 360-degree sphere, ensuring comprehensive coverage. Lighting is consistent across all views to enhance the reflective properties of the car's metallic finish. Improvements focus on angle diversity and lighting consistency, addressing previous feedback.
