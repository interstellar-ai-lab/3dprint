The car is positioned against a completely pure white background with no shadows or additional elements. Lighting across all images is consistent to enhance the visibility of the car's features and maintain uniformity throughout the grid. The angles include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. The car's color, texture, and design details remain identical in all images, ensuring precise 3D reconstruction capability. Previous feedback is addressed by focusing on lighting consistency and angle diversity.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"Create a PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, of the EXACT SAME modem sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each sub-image must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modem sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modem sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image consists of a 4x4 grid showcasing a modem sport car from 16 different angles, each meticulously captured to ensure diversity in viewpoints for effective 3D reconstruction. The car is consistently lit and displayed against a pure white background, enhancing clarity and focusing solely on the object. Improvements based on historical feedback include optimized lighting consistency and a comprehensive angle distribution, addressing previous issues and maintaining object consistency.\",\n    \"previous_iteration_metadata\": {\n        \"all_iterations\": 7,\n        \"latest_scores\": {\n            \"image_quality\": 0,\n            \"metadata_accuracy\": 0,\n            \"completeness\": 0\n        },\n        \"latest_suggestions\": \"Continue improving the generation\",\n        \"latest_metadata_suggestions\": \"Improve metadata with more specific details\",\n        \"historical_analysis\": \"\\n    \ud83e\udde0 INTELLIGENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT:\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83d\udcca PATTERN ANALYSIS:\\n    Score Progression: Iteration 1: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 2: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 3: 1.0 \u2192 Iteration 4: 1.7 \u2192 Iteration 5: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 6: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 7: 0.0\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udd0d MOST CRITICAL ISSUES:\\n    lighting consistency (4 times), angle diversity (4 times), grid layout (4 times)\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udca1 RECOMMENDED FOCUS:\\n    lighting consistency, angle diversity\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83c\udfaf IMMEDIATE FOCUS (from most recent iteration):\\n    - Latest scores: {'image_quality': 0, 'metadata_accuracy': 0, 'completeness': 0}\\n    - Most recent suggestions: Continue improving the generation\\n    - Metadata suggestions: Improve metadata with more specific details\\n    \\n    \ud83d\ude80 STRATEGIC IMPROVEMENT APPROACH:\\n    - Address the most critical recurring issues first\\n    - Build on what has worked in previous iterations\\n    - Avoid repeating failed approaches\\n    - Focus on the specific issues that haven't been resolved\\n    \",\n        \"previous_object_details\": \"A ",
