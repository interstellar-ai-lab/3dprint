Each sub-image showcases the car from unique angles, including the essential front, back, left, right, top, and bottom views, complemented by ten evenly distributed oblique angles around the object. The modem sport car is displayed consistently with identical appearance, details, and characteristics across all images, with modifications only in the camera angles. Lighting is uniformly applied to ensure no shadows or inconsistent brightness across views. The car is placed on a pure white background with no other objects or environmental elements present, ensuring clarity and focus on the car alone. This setup adheres strictly to the 4x4 grid requirement, with each image separated and aligned perfectly.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modem sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modem sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modem sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modem sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image comprises a perfect 4x4 grid of a modem sport car, providing 16 distinct angles for optimal 3D reconstruction. This setup ensures comprehensive coverage of the car's geometry and features from every relevant perspective, facilitating precise digital modeling. The improvements focus on maintaining consistent lighting and angle diversity, addressing previous feedback issues. The car remains identical across all views, adhering to the critical object consistency requirement, with enhancements in technical quality and grid alignment.\",\n    \"previous_iteration_metadata\": {\n        \"all_iterations\": 15,\n        \"latest_scores\": {\n            \"image_quality\": 0,\n            \"metadata_accuracy\": 0,\n            \"completeness\": 0\n        },\n        \"latest_suggestions\": \"Continue improving the generation\",\n        \"latest_metadata_suggestions\": \"Improve metadata with more specific details\",\n        \"historical_analysis\": \"\\n    \ud83e\udde0 INTELLIGENT HISTORICAL CONTEXT:\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83d\udcca PATTERN ANALYSIS:\\n    Score Progression: Iteration 1: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 2: 1.3 \u2192 Iteration 3: 1.0 \u2192 Iteration 4: 1.7 \u2192 Iteration 5: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 6: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 7: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 8: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 9: 2.3 \u2192 Iteration 10: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 11: 1.7 \u2192 Iteration 12: 2.7 \u2192 Iteration 13: 0.0 \u2192 Iteration 14: 1.0 \u2192 Iteration 15: 0.0\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udd0d MOST CRITICAL ISSUES:\\n    lighting consistency (8 times), angle diversity (8 times), grid layout (8 times)\\n    \\n    \ud83d\udca1 RECOMMENDED FOCUS:\\n    lighting consistency, angle diversity\\n    \\n    \\n    \ud83c\udfaf IMMEDIATE FOCUS (from most recent iteration):\\n    - Latest scores: {'image_quality': 0, 'metadata_accuracy': ",
