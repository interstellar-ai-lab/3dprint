  "target_object": "a modern sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "A sleek, aerodynamic modern sport car featuring a smooth, streamlined body with a glossy metallic finish in a vibrant red color. The car has a low, aggressive stance with sharp lines and curves, a distinctive front grille, LED headlights, and alloy wheels. It features a rear spoiler and dual exhausts. The image includes 16 views for 3D reconstruction: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles. Each view is captured with consistent lighting, showing the car in a completely pure white background with no shadows or additional elements. No previous feedback available. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.",
  "description": "This image set provides 16 distinct views of a modern sport car, ideal for 3D reconstruction. Each view maintains object consistency with identical features, enhancing the ability to accurately model the car in three dimensions. The pure white background and consistent lighting ensure clarity and focus on the car, facilitating precise reconstruction. There is no previous feedback to incorporate, so the focus is on maintaining the object's details and improving angle diversity.",
