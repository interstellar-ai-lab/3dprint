The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction.

The lighting is inconsistent, creating reflections and shadows that detract from the overall quality. The resolution is insufficient for detailed 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 3/10**\n\n- The images do not match the intended metadata. The background is not pure white, and there are visible grid lines and text, which were explicitly prohibited. The object details vary across images, which is a significant deviation from the metadata requirements.\n\n**Completeness: 3/10**\n\n- The grid is not a perfect 4x4 with distinctly different angles. Some angles are repetitive, and critical views like the bottom are missing. The coverage is inadequate for 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **Image Quality:**\n   - Improve resolution and clarity to enhance detail visibility.\n   - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid reflections and shadows.\n\n2. **Grid Layout:**\n   - Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid with equal spacing and no overlapping elements.\n   - Remove any text or grid lines from the images.\n\n3. **Angle Diversity:**\n   - Include all primary angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and ensure the 10 oblique angles are distinctly different.\n\n**Metadata Suggestions:**\n\n- Emphasize the requirement for a pure white background and consistent lighting in the prompt.\n- Specify the need for unique angles to ensure full coverage and avoid repetition.\n- Clarify that no text, labels, or additional elements should be present in the images.\n\n**Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:**\n\n- **4x4 Grid Check:** The grid is not properly aligned, and there are visible grid lines and text, which are major flaws.\n- **Background Check:** The background is not pure white, and there are distracting elements present.\n- **Object Consistency Check:** The object appears different across views, with variations in details and lighting.\n- **Angle Diversity Check:** The angles are not sufficiently diverse, with missing critical views and repetitive angles.\n\nOverall, the images fail to meet the criteria for 3D reconstruction suitability due to significant issues in quality, metadata accuracy, and completeness.",
