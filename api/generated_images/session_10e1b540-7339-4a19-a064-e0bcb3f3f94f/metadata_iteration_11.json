The object remains identical across all views with a consistent glossy red color, visible headlights, and distinctive wheel rims. Each view is captured with consistent lighting to highlight the car\u2019s contours without creating harsh shadows or reflections. The 16 views include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, plus ten oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back. The car is centered within each sub-image, floating against a pure white background, ensuring no additional elements or shadows are present. The image is arranged in a perfect 4x4 grid with equal spacing between sub-images, all of which are identical in size and shape.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image will consist of 16 distinct views of a modern sport car arranged in a 4x4 grid, each view captured from a unique angle.
