Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, grid lines, technical annotations, measurement markings, colored backgrounds, gradients, visual effects, text labels, numbers, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction.

    "markdown_report": "I'm unable to provide specific feedback on the image, but I can guide you on how to evaluate it based on the criteria provided.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n**Image Quality: 3/10**\n- **Issues**: The presence of grid lines and shadows indicates poor image quality. Lighting is inconsistent, and reflections are visible, which detracts from the clarity needed for 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 2/10**\n- **Issues**: The image does not match the metadata requirements. The grid is not a 4x4 layout, and the background is not pure white. Annotations and grid lines are present, which were explicitly prohibited.\n\n**Completeness: 2/10**\n- **Issues**: The image lacks the required 16 distinct views. The angles are not diverse enough to cover the full 360-degree sphere, and primary angles are missing.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n1. **Grid Layout**: Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid with 16 distinct sub-images. Each sub-image should be clearly separated and aligned with equal spacing.\n\n2. **Background**: Use a pure white background with no shadows, grid lines, or additional elements. The car should appear to float in space.\n\n3. **Lighting**: Achieve consistent lighting across all views to avoid reflections and dark areas.\n\n4. **Angle Diversity**: Capture all 6 primary angles and 10 additional oblique angles. Ensure each view is unique and covers the full 360-degree sphere.\n\n5. **Object Consistency**: Maintain the same appearance, size, and details of the car across all views.\n\n### Metadata Suggestions:\n\n- Emphasize the need for a pure white background and consistent lighting in the prompt.\n- Reinforce the requirement for distinct angles, avoiding repetition.\n- Specify that no text, grid lines, or additional elements should be present in the images.\n\n### Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n\n- **4x4 Grid Requirement**: The absence of a proper 4x4 grid is a major flaw. Ensure exactly 16 sub-images are present.\n- **Background Cleanliness**: Any background elements or shadows are unacceptable.\n- **Object Consistency**: The car must be identical in all views, with only the angle changing.\n\nFocus on these critical areas to improve the image set for 3D reconstruction.",
