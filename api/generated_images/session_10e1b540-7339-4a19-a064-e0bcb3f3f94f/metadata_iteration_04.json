The car must be a vibrant red with no alterations to its appearance, details, or characteristics. The grid consists of 16 distinct angles, including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles to cover the full 360-degree sphere. Each viewpoint is unique, with the car appearing to float in a pure white background, free of shadows and external elements. Lighting consistency is maintained across all views, critical for achieving high-quality images suitable for 3D reconstruction. The prompt emphasizes the removal of grid lines and text annotations to meet the requirements of previous feedback iterations.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles.

Each sub-image shows the car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint, including: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows or additional elements. CRITICAL: NO grid lines, annotations, or text should be present.
