  "target_object": "cat",
  "generation_metadata": "The images capture a domestic cat from 16 unique angles needed for 3D reconstruction. Each photograph highlights distinct features like ear position, fur patterns, and paw structure, offering comprehensive coverage from straight-on views to top and bottom perspectives. Consistent and soft lighting emphasizes texture without creating shadows, and a pure white background contrasts with the cat's fur. The cat maintains a neutral posture, ideally standing or sitting to ensure clarity of anatomical features in each shot.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a cat captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the cat from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The cat is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will display a cat from 16 different viewpoints in a 4x4 grid. This is instrumental for 3D reconstruction, providing comprehensive visual data to accurately model the cat's shape, texture, and features. The consistent environmental conditions across images ensure uniformity necessary for accurate computational modeling.",
