  "generation_metadata": "This set of sixteen photographs is designed to facilitate 3D reconstruction of a car. Each image in the 4x4 grid displays the car from a unique angle: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, top-front oblique, top-back oblique, top-left oblique, top-right oblique, bottom-front oblique, and bottom-back oblique. The car is consistently centered in each image with uniform lighting to ensure clarity and detail visibility. The background is a pure white with no shadows or distractions, enhancing focus on the car. The car should be a generic model with neutral colors to avoid any brand-specific elements. This setup provides comprehensive coverage for accurate 3D modeling.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from distinct angles: front, back, left side, right side, top, bottom, and various oblique angles including front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. Each image should have the car centered, with consistent lighting and scale across all views, and a pure white background with no shadows or other objects. Ensure each angle is unique and clearly labeled for 3D reconstruction purposes, addressing previous feedback by maintaining uniform lighting and comprehensive angle coverage.",
  "description": "The generated image consists of a grid of 16 distinct views of a car, specifically designed for 3D reconstruction. Improvements include the correction of view labeling errors, ensuring each view is unique and covers a broad range of angles, including various oblique and top/bottom perspectives. The lighting is consistent across all images, with a neutral background to avoid distractions. This setup maximizes the potential for accurate and detailed 3D modeling by providing comprehensive visual data.",

  "previous_iteration_metadata": "1. **View Labels**: Correct the labeling errors (e.g., \"Real Vew,\" \"Bak Vight\"). Ensure each view is correctly labeled and distinct. 2. **Angle Coverage**: Include more diverse angles, such as oblique views, to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy. Specify these in the metadata. 3. **Prompt Clarity**: Clearly define the need for unique angles and consistent lighting in the prompt to avoid repetition and ensure comprehensive coverage."
