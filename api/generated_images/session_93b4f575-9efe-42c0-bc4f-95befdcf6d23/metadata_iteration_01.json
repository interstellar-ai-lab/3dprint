  "generation_metadata": "The generated image will feature a set of sixteen digital photographs of a car, arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each sub-image captures the car from a distinct angle: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles (such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, bottom-front, and bottom-back). Consistent lighting is used to eliminate shadows and ensure uniform visibility of details. The car is centered in each view with the same scale and positioning, making it ideal for 3D reconstruction. The background is a pure white, creating a clean and unobtrusive backdrop with no shadows or extraneous objects. Material properties like glossiness of the car's paint and transparency of the windows are subtly highlighted to provide accurate texture information.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, bottom-front, and bottom-back. The car is centered in each view with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction. The car should have a glossy paint finish and transparent windows, with lighting that highlights these material properties. Ensure the car's details, such as lights, wheels, and grille, are clearly visible and uniformly lit across all views.",
  "description": "The generated image provides 16 views of a car, arranged in a 4x4 grid, perfect for 3D reconstruction tasks. Each view captures the car from a unique angle, ensuring comprehensive coverage of its geometry. Improvements include enhanced lighting consistency and material property visibility, such as glossiness and window transparency, based on feedback for better texture and detail capture.",

Ensure uniform lighting across all views to enhance detail visibility.\n2. **Completeness**: The grid does not show 16 distinct views; several views are repeated or mislabeled. Ensure each image represents a unique angle, including oblique and top/bottom views.\n3. **Background**: The background is consistent, which is good, but ensure it remains neutral in all images to avoid distractions.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n1. **View Labels**: Correct the labeling errors (e.g., \"Real Vew,\" \"Bak Vight\"). Ensure each view is correctly labeled and distinct.\n2. **Angle Coverage**: Include more diverse angles, such as oblique views, to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy. Specify these in the metadata.\n3. **Prompt Clarity**: Clearly define the need for unique angles and consistent lighting in the prompt to avoid repetition and ensure comprehensive coverage.",
