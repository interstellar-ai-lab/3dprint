  "target_object": "a model sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "The object is a model sport car with sleek aerodynamic lines, a shiny metallic finish, and distinct features like a sporty front grille, low-profile tires, and a compact yet aggressive stance. Each of the 16 views consists of consistent lighting and scale, ensuring accurate representation from each angle. The angles include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, back-left oblique, back-right oblique, as well as high-angle and low-angle perspectives from each corner. The lighting is soft and diffused to avoid harsh reflections, enhancing the visibility of details. The car should have no visible brand logos, focusing on generic design features suitable for a model car.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid, showcasing a model sport car from various angles for 3D reconstruction. The car has sleek, aerodynamic lines and a metallic finish, with features like a sporty front grille and low-profile tires. The images include front, back, left, right, top, and bottom views, as well as front-left, front-right, back-left, and back-right oblique views. Additional views are captured from high and low angles at each corner. The car is centered in each view against a pure white background with no shadows or other objects. Lighting is consistent and diffused to eliminate harsh reflections, allowing clear visibility of all details. The car should be free of brand logos and have a generic design, ideal for use in 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image consists of 16 views of a model sport car, arranged in a 4x4 grid, each view capturing a different angle and perspective. This comprehensive set of images can be used for 3D reconstruction by providing all necessary angles with consistent lighting and scale. Improvements include specific angle descriptions and enhanced lighting specifications to avoid harsh reflections, addressing prior feedback for clearer and more detailed images.",

Ensure all images maintain this quality.\n2. **Completeness**: The set lacks bottom views and more diverse angles. Include top and bottom perspectives and more oblique angles to improve 3D reconstruction accuracy.\n3. **Grid Layout**: Ensure all images are aligned properly in the grid. The current layout is consistent, but maintaining this is crucial.\n4. **Background**: The background is consistent, but ensure it remains neutral and unobtrusive in all images.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n1. Specify the need for a complete set of views, including top, bottom, and oblique angles.\n2. Emphasize the importance of consistent lighting and background in the metadata.\n3. Include instructions for maintaining a clean grid layout with distinct views.",
