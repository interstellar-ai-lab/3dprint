  "generation_metadata": "Detailed description of the object and the 16 views for 3D reconstruction. The dog is a medium-sized, short-haired Labrador Retriever with a golden coat. The fur is smooth and glossy. The dog has a friendly expression with large, brown eyes, a broad, black nose, and floppy ears. Its tail is medium-length and slightly curved. Each of the 16 views must show this exact dog from different angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). The lighting must be soft and even to avoid shadows. The dog is centered in each view with consistent scale and positioning on a pure white background. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views. Learning from 0 previous iterations.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME medium-sized, short-haired Labrador Retriever dog with a golden coat. The dog has large brown eyes, a broad black nose, and floppy ears, with a medium-length curved tail. Each sub-image shows the IDENTICAL dog from a DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angle: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Each angle covers the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The dog is centered in each view with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the dog should be visible - NO other objects or environmental elements. The background is COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or additional elements. The dog should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image. DO NOT create 3x3 grids or any other format - ONLY 4x4 grids with exactly 16 sub-images.",
  "description": "The generated image will feature a 4x4 grid of a Labrador Retriever dog with consistent details across 16 different viewing angles. This setup is ideal for 3D reconstruction, capturing the dog from every necessary perspective while ensuring no additional elements interfere with the reconstruction process. The white background and consistent lighting enhance the clarity of the object's features, addressing the need for clear and unobstructed views for accurate 3D modeling.",
