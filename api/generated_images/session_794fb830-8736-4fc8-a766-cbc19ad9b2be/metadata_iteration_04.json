  "target_object": "a sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "The generated image must feature a sport car in a perfect 4x4 grid layout, showcasing 16 distinct views for 3D reconstruction. Each sub-image should display the sport car from a different angle, including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and ten additional oblique angles. Each view must maintain consistent lighting and be against a pure white background with no shadows or reflections. The sport car must remain identical across all views in terms of size, shape, color, texture, and material properties. This approach addresses lighting consistency, angle diversity, and background issues identified in previous iterations.",
  "image_prompt": "A perfect 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each sub-image must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space, such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back. Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views. The sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.",
  "description": "This generated image is designed for 3D reconstruction, offering a comprehensive set of views of a sport car. It addresses previous feedback by ensuring consistent lighting, diverse angles, and a clean white background, crucial for accurate reconstruction. The consistency in object details across all views supports precise modeling.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 5/10\n- The images are generally clear, but there are noticeable lighting inconsistencies and shadows. The resolution is acceptable, but not exceptional.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 4/10\n- The images do not match the requirement of a 4x4 grid. Only 12 images are present, which is a significant deviation from the metadata requirements.\n\nCompleteness: 3/10\n- The coverage is poor, with only 12 views instead of the required 16. Important angles, such as the bottom and some oblique views, are missing.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure a complete 4x4 grid with exactly 16 images, covering all necessary angles.\n- Maintain consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and reflections.\n- Improve resolution and focus to enhance clarity and detail.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Specify the requirement for a full 4x4 grid with 16 distinct angles.\n- Include instructions for consistent lighting and a pure white background.\n- Emphasize the need for all primary and oblique angles to be captured.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The absence of a proper 4x4 grid is a major flaw, leading to low scores.\n- Lighting inconsistencies and shadows are significant issues.\n- Missing angles severely impact the suitability for 3D reconstruction.",
