  "target_object": "a sport car",
  "generation_metadata": "Detailed description of the object and the 16 views for 3D reconstruction, including specific angle descriptions, lighting specifications, material properties, and geometric constraints. The sport car is a sleek, modern vehicle with aerodynamic contours, a glossy red finish, and distinctive features like a prominent front grille, angular headlights, and low-profile tires. The car's surface should reflect light evenly without harsh shadows. The 16 views consist of front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and ten additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Each angle provides a unique perspective, ensuring full 360-degree coverage for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views. Learning from 0 previous iterations.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.",
  "description": "This generated image is a 4x4 grid featuring 16 different views of a sport car. Each view provides a unique angle, crucial for 3D reconstruction, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the object. The background is pure white, and the sport car remains identical across all views, maintaining consistency in all visual details. This setup allows for accurate 3D modeling, as there are no distractions or inconsistencies in the object presentation.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 6/10\n- The images are generally clear, but there are noticeable lighting inconsistencies and reflections that detract from the overall quality. Some images appear slightly overexposed.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 5/10\n- The images match the target object, but the presence of a platform and markings on the ground is not ideal. The metadata should specify a completely clean background.\n\nCompleteness: 5/10\n- While there are multiple angles, the coverage is not ideal for 3D reconstruction. Some angles are repetitive, and the primary angles are not distinctly covered.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid reflections and overexposure.\n- Remove any platforms or markings from the background to maintain a clean, neutral space.\n- Capture a wider variety of angles, ensuring all primary and oblique angles are distinct and cover the full 360-degree sphere.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Specify a pure white background with no additional elements or reflections.\n- Include instructions for capturing all primary angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and diverse oblique angles.\n- Emphasize the need for consistent lighting and object centering in each view.",
