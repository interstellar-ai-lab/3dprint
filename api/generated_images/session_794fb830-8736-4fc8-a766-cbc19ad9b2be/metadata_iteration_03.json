Each photo maintains the exact same car model, with consistent lighting and no visual artifacts. The sport car is isolated against a pure white background, devoid of shadows or additional objects, ensuring clarity and focus. Each sub-image captures a unique angle, including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and additional oblique angles such as front-left, back-right, top-front, and others for full 360-degree coverage. All images are high resolution for detailed texture and material observation. These images address previous feedback focusing on lighting consistency, angle diversity, and background purity, ensuring all images of the car are from the same model and exhibit identical features across varied angles.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image provides a complete set of 16 distinct angles of the same sport car model, ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks. Improvements from historical feedback include enhanced lighting consistency, ensuring a pure white background, and maintaining the same car model across all angles.
