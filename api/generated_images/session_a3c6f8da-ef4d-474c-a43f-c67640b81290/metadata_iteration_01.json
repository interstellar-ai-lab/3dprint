  "generation_metadata": "The image features a sport car rendered in sixteen distinct views arranged in a 4x4 grid, suitable for 3D reconstruction. The car is captured from multiple angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles to ensure comprehensive coverage. The lighting is uniform and diffuse, eliminating shadows and reflections. The sport car is centered in each view, with consistent scale and positioning. The design highlights aerodynamic contours, smooth surfaces, and characteristic sport car elements like sleek headlights, low-profile tires, and a prominent spoiler. The background is entirely white, ensuring no distractions.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a sport car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the sport car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles, ensuring full coverage for 3D reconstruction. The sport car is centered in each view with consistent lighting that is soft and evenly distributed, avoiding harsh shadows or reflections. The car features sleek, aerodynamic lines, a glossy finish, low-profile tires, and a prominent rear spoiler. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, creating a clean canvas for accurate 3D modeling.",
  "description": "The generated image provides a comprehensive set of views for a sport car, ideal for 3D reconstruction. Improvements include a focus on uniform lighting to prevent shadows, a clear white background, and consistent scale and positioning of the car across different angles. This setup ensures accurate and efficient 3D modeling.",

The current set lacks these perspectives.\n3. **Background Consistency**: Maintain a consistent, neutral background.
