  "generation_metadata": "The image consists of a modern sedan captured in 16 distinct views for precise 3D reconstruction. Views include front, back, left side, right side, top, bottom, four primary oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right) and four additional intermediate angles for increased detail. Lighting is uniform across all images, with diffused ambient light to minimize shadows and reflections. The car's body material, paint finish, and texture details are accurately represented, maintaining geometric consistency in dimensions and proportions.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image contains a car displayed from 16 different perspectives, ideal for computational 3D modeling and reconstruction. Each view aids in capturing the car's full geometry, ensuring accurate rendering of its design features, body curves, and proportionate outlines. This comprehensive visual data set serves as a foundational input for 3D graphics software used in virtual reality, simulation, and digital twin creation.",
