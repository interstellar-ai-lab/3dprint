  "generation_metadata": "The image portrays a modern sedan from 16 distinct viewpoints aiding 3D reconstruction: front, back, left, right, top-down, bottom-up, and four oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right). Additional intermediate angles such as a 45-degree elevation view from the front and back enhance its dimensionality. The lighting employs a 3-point setup for consistent illumination and minimized shadows or reflections on all surfaces. The car's surface features a glossy metallic paint with fine detailing around the wheels and headlights, accurately represented and proportionally scaled.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen high-quality digital photographs in a 4x4 grid showing a car from diverse angles for 3D reconstruction. Each picture provides a unique view: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and varying oblique angles, combined with intermediate views at 45 degrees. The car is consistently centered, well-lit with a uniform, soft ambient lighting setup, eliminating shadows and reflections. The white background ensures focus solely on the car.",
  "description": "The created image offers a comprehensive set of views of a car for detailed 3D modeling. It includes both standard and dynamic angles, utilizing uniform lighting for unobstructed visibility of all details and textures. This resource facilitates accurate 3D rendering and is ideal for applications in VR simulations, automotive design, and digital visualizations.",
