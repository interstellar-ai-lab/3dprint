Each angle is clearly defined and includes primary angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). The cat's appearance, size, color, texture, and other visual details remain identical across all views, ensuring object consistency. The images are organized in a 4x4 grid, with consistent lighting to avoid exposure issues, a pure white background for neutrality, and high resolution to improve clarity and detail. Each view is centered and correctly labeled to correspond with the metadata. This setup addresses previous feedback by correcting grid layout issues, ensuring even distribution of angles, maintaining consistent lighting, and using a neutral background.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A set of sixteen high-resolution digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid, showcasing the EXACT SAME cute cat from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each sub-image captures the identical cat from a unique 3D viewpoint, covering the full 360-degree sphere. The series includes primary angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles: front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back. Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle with no similar viewpoints. The cat must remain consistent in appearance, size, shape, and texture across all views. Use consistent, even lighting to prevent exposure issues, and ensure the cat is centered in each view. The background should be pure white with no shadows or artifacts, suitable for 3D reconstruction. This prompt addresses past feedback by resolving issues with grid layout, lighting, angle coverage, and background neutrality.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image is a comprehensive set of 16 views of the same cute cat, arranged in a 4x4 grid for 3D reconstruction.

Some images appear sharper than others, and there are noticeable differences in color saturation.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 3/10\n- The images do not consistently match the metadata. The labels are inconsistent, and the views do not align with the descriptions provided (e.g., \"Front view\" and \"Side view\" are repeated without clear distinction).\n\nCompleteness: 2/10\n- The set fails to provide a comprehensive 360-degree view. There is a lack of distinct angles, and many images appear to be similar or redundant. The primary angles are not clearly represented.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting and focus across all images to improve clarity and quality.\n- Provide a wider range of distinct angles, including the six primary views and additional oblique angles.\n- Maintain a neutral background to avoid distractions and ensure the cat is perfectly centered in each image.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Clearly label each image with accurate descriptions of the view angle.\n- Ensure that the metadata matches the actual content of each image, reflecting the correct perspective and orientation.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The object consistency is poor; there are variations in the cat's appearance across images.\n- The angle diversity is lacking, with many images showing similar perspectives.\n- The grid does not adhere to the 4x4 requirement effectively, as some images do not provide unique 3D perspective information.",
