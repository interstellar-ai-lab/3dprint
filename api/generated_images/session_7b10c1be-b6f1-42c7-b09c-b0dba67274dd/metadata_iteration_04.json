The grid must include the main six views (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and ten additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Each image must capture the cat from a unique perspective to ensure complete 360-degree coverage. The lighting should be even and consistent across all images, with a pure white background to maintain focus on the cat, avoiding shadows or distractions. The cat's appearance must be identical in all images, maintaining the same size, shape, color, texture, and material properties across all views. This ensures object consistency and quality for effective 3D reconstruction. The prompt addresses past feedback by ensuring complete angle diversity, consistent lighting, and a neutral background, overcoming previous issues with object consistency and angle repetition.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring the EXACT SAME cute cat captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each sub-image presents the IDENTICAL cat from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. Include the primary six views: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and ten additional oblique angles: front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back. Ensure each grid position showcases a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle, with no two grids sharing similar viewpoints. The cat's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. Center the cat in each view, maintaining consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction. This prompt adheres to previous feedback by guaranteeing full angle coverage, consistent object appearance, and an appropriate background.\",\n    \"description\": \"This image set, generated from a specific prompt, features a cute cat viewed from 16 distinct angles, ensuring full 360-degree coverage for 3D reconstruction. The prompt ensures complete angle diversity and consistent lighting, addressing previous feedback by maintaining the cat's identical appearance across all images and providing a neutral white background.

The overall quality is cartoonish, which may not be suitable for realistic 3D reconstruction.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 3/10\n- The images do not match the typical requirements for 3D reconstruction metadata. The views are labeled, but the labels are inconsistent and confusing (e.g., \"SOP VIEW,\" \"COF VIEW\").\n\nCompleteness: 2/10\n- The set lacks the required 16 distinct angles. Many views are repetitive, and there is no coverage of the full 360-degree sphere. Important angles like the bottom view are missing.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure all 16 views are included, covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object.\n- Improve lighting consistency across all images.\n- Use a neutral background to avoid distractions.\n- Ensure each view is distinctly different to provide unique 3D perspective information.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Clearly define and label each angle correctly (e.g., front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and additional oblique angles).\n- Ensure the metadata accurately reflects the content and purpose of each image.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The images do not meet the 4x4 grid requirement, with only 12 views present.\n- Lighting and focus inconsistencies are evident.\n- The object is not consistently centered in each view.\n- There are significant overlaps in angles, reducing the effectiveness for 3D reconstruction.\n- Object consistency is lacking due to variations in depiction style across views.",
