  "generation_metadata": "This image contains a 4x4 grid of sixteen digital photographs of a car. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct angle: front, rear, left side, right side, top view, bottom view, front-left oblique, front-right oblique, rear-left oblique, rear-right oblique, top-front-left, top-front-right, top-rear-left, top-rear-right, bottom-front-left, and bottom-front-right. The car is uniformly lit with soft, even lighting to minimize shadows and ensure consistent exposure across all views. The car's material properties, such as reflective surfaces and color, are accurately depicted. The background is pure white, with no distractions, ensuring focus on the car for effective 3D reconstruction.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The image generated is a comprehensive set of sixteen different views of a car, arranged in a 4x4 grid format. These views include standard angles such as front, back, sides, and top, as well as various oblique perspectives, providing a robust dataset for 3D reconstruction tasks. The consistent lighting and pure white background enhance the car's features, making it ideal for 3D modeling and analysis.",
