  "generation_metadata": "The image contains 16 views of a car arranged in a 4x4 grid, aimed at 3D reconstruction. The views include: 1. Front view, head-on. 2. Rear view, directly from the back. 3. Left side view, perpendicular. 4. Right side view, perpendicular. 5. Top-down view. 6. Bottom-up view, showing the undercarriage. 7. Front-left oblique view. 8. Front-right oblique view. 9. Rear-left oblique view. 10. Rear-right oblique view. 11. Slightly above front view. 12. Slightly above rear view. 13. Slightly below front view. 14. Slightly below rear view. 15. Left side view from a slight above angle. 16. Right side view from a slight above angle. Each view is centered with consistent lighting from a soft studio light to avoid hard shadows, ensuring uniform illumination across all angles. The car's surface is glossy, with reflections clearly visible to emphasize its contours and material properties. The background is a pure white, ensuring no distractions from the car's geometry.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "This generated image provides a comprehensive set of 16 views of a car, essential for 3D reconstruction. The consistent lighting and diverse angles ensure that all aspects of the car's geometry are captured, facilitating accurate model creation.",
