  "generation_metadata": "The image contains sixteen distinct views of a car, each captured from a different angle, arranged in a 4x4 grid. The angles include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, and back-right. The lighting is consistent across all views, ensuring the car is uniformly illuminated without harsh shadows. The car is displayed on a pure white background to eliminate distractions, and the scale and positioning are consistent to aid in 3D reconstruction. Each view highlights the car's contours, surface materials, and structural details, essential for accurate 3D modeling.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image provides a comprehensive set of views necessary for 3D reconstruction of a car. By capturing the car from multiple angles and maintaining consistent lighting and positioning, the image set enables the extraction of geometric and material properties needed for creating an accurate 3D model.",
