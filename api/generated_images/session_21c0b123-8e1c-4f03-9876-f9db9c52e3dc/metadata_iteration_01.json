  "generation_metadata": "Sixteen distinct views of a car are required for a comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Each view should capture the car from different angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique perspectives (e.g., front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right). The lighting should be uniform and soft to minimize shadows and ensure clear visibility of the car's details. The car should be scaled consistently across all images, centered in each frame, and free from any background distractions. The material of the car should appear realistic, with attention to the reflective surfaces and textures such as metal, glass, and rubber.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image will consist of 16 sub-images showing a car from various angles, which is ideal for creating a 3D model of the car. By providing views from all significant angles, the images allow for accurate capture of the car's geometry and surface details, essential for reconstruction processes.",
