  "target_object": "a modern sports car",
  "generation_metadata": "The image contains 16 distinct views of a modern sports car, arranged in a 4x4 grid. The views include the front (0 degrees), back (180 degrees), left (270 degrees), right (90 degrees), top (0 degrees vertically), bottom (180 degrees vertically), and various oblique angles such as front-left (45 degrees), front-right (315 degrees), back-left (135 degrees), back-right (225 degrees), top-front (30 degrees vertically), top-back (150 degrees vertically), top-left (60 degrees vertically), top-right (300 degrees vertically), bottom-front (210 degrees vertically), and bottom-back (330 degrees vertically). The lighting is consistent across all views, with soft, even illumination that reduces shadows and enhances the visibility of details. The car's material is a glossy metallic paint, and the reflections are minimal to ensure clear visibility of the car's shape and features. The model is centered in each sub-image with a pure white background, eliminating distractions and focusing on the car's design.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a modern sports car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the modern sports car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The modern sports car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image presents a modern sports car from 16 different angles, enabling comprehensive 3D reconstruction. The views are arranged in a 4x4 grid, providing a complete representation of the car's design and structure from all significant perspectives. This setup ensures that all necessary angles and details are captured, facilitating accurate modeling and analysis.",
