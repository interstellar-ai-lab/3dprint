  "target_object": "a desk",
  "generation_metadata": "The object is a modern office desk made of light oak wood with a smooth finish. It features a minimalist design with clean lines and no additional objects present. The desk has a flat top surface, four legs, and an integrated drawer on the right side. The 16 views include: front view (showing the full frontal profile), back view (showing the rear and legs), left side view, right side view, top-down view (showing the entire surface), bottom view (highlighting the leg attachment), and 10 oblique angles capturing various perspectives around the desk. All images have consistent, diffused lighting to minimize shadows and highlights, ensuring clear visibility of all surfaces. The background is a completely neutral white with no texture or objects, enhancing the visibility of the desk and ensuring no distractions. High resolution and minimal compression are used to eliminate artifacts and blurring. Each view is distinctly labeled with its angle and position to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen high-resolution digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a modern office desk captured from diverse angles. Each sub-image displays the desk from a unique viewpoint: front view, back view, left side view, right side view, top-down view, bottom view, and ten oblique angles. Ensure each angle is distinctly different, covering all necessary perspectives for 3D reconstruction. The desk should be centered in each image, with consistent soft lighting avoiding shadows and highlights, on a pure white background with no other objects visible. Use high resolution to prevent compression artifacts and maintain clarity. Each image must be labeled with its specific angle to avoid confusion, such as 'Front View', 'Left Oblique', etc.",
  "description": "The generated image is a single composite of 16 distinct views of a modern office desk, designed for effective 3D reconstruction. Improvements made based on previous feedback include consistent, soft lighting across all images to avoid shadows and highlights, a completely neutral white background to enhance object visibility, and high resolution to prevent artifacts. Each view is distinctly different and labeled, facilitating accurate reconstruction and avoiding confusion.",

    "markdown_report": "**Image Quality: 5/10**  \n- The images have noticeable lighting inconsistencies and shadows that vary across the set.  \n- Some images show slight blur and lack sharpness.  \n- There are visible artifacts and compression issues.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 6/10**  \n- The desk is generally consistent with a typical office desk, but there are variations in objects placed on it.  \n- Some images have additional elements not described in metadata.\n\n**Completeness: 4/10**  \n- The set does not provide a full 16-view coverage; some angles are repetitive.  \n- Several important angles are missing, affecting the potential for accurate 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and variations.  \n- Increase the resolution and focus to eliminate blur and enhance clarity.  \n- Remove any visual artifacts and ensure a clean, neutral background.  \n- Provide a full 16-view coverage with distinctly different angles for each image.\n\n**Metadata Suggestions:**  \n- Specify the exact objects to be included on the desk to ensure consistency.  \n- Clarify the required background and lighting conditions to avoid discrepancies.  \n- Include detailed instructions for the positioning and centering of the desk in each view.",
