  "generation_metadata": "This set of images is designed for 3D reconstruction of a desk, addressing previous feedback issues. The 16 views are captured with consistent, shadow-free lighting, ensuring uniformity across all images. The desk is photographed in high resolution, with a focus on capturing fine details such as grain, edges, and joints. Each image is centered, with the desk isolated against a pure white background to remove distractions. The views include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles, ensuring comprehensive coverage. The desk's material properties, such as wood texture or metal fixtures, should be clearly visible. The angles are carefully chosen to cover all geometric aspects of the desk, ensuring that no part is obscured or duplicated unnecessarily.",
  "image_prompt": "A 4x4 grid of sixteen high-resolution digital photographs, each showing a desk from unique angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique perspectives. Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and maintain uniformity. The desk should be centered in each image, isolated against a pure white background with no other objects present. Focus on capturing fine details such as wood grain, edges, and joints, with high resolution to enhance image quality. The angles should be distinct and varied, covering all aspects of the desk comprehensively to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "This generated image provides a comprehensive set of 16 views of a desk, specifically addressing the issues identified in previous feedback. The images feature consistent lighting, a pure white background, and high resolution to capture fine details, ensuring suitability for 3D reconstruction. The distinct and varied angles cover all necessary perspectives of the desk, improving completeness and quality over prior iterations.",

    "markdown_report": "**Image Quality: 6/10**  \nThe images are generally clear, but there are noticeable inconsistencies in lighting and focus across the set. Some images appear slightly overexposed, and there are minor artifacts present.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 4/10**  \nThe images do not consistently depict the same desk design, which deviates from the expected metadata. There are variations in the desk features that are not accounted for in the metadata.\n\n**Completeness: 5/10**  \nWhile there are multiple angles, the coverage is inconsistent. Some angles are repeated with minimal variation, and important perspectives are missing. The 4x4 grid requirement is met, but the distinctiveness of each view is lacking.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid overexposure and maintain uniformity.  \n- Focus on maintaining the same desk design throughout to improve metadata accuracy.  \n- Capture a wider range of distinct angles to provide a more comprehensive view of the desk.  \n- Remove any visual artifacts and ensure each image is in sharp focus.\n\n**Metadata Suggestions:**  \n- Clearly define the specific desk design to be used in the metadata to prevent variations.  \n- Include detailed descriptions of the angles required to ensure comprehensive coverage.  \n- Specify lighting conditions to maintain consistency across all images.",
