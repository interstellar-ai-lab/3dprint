  "generation_metadata": "This set of sixteen digital photographs features a desk captured from various distinct angles: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and twelve oblique angles (three from each corner of the desk at varying heights). Each view is clearly labeled and distinct to avoid repetition. The desk is centered in each frame with consistent, soft, and diffused lighting to eliminate shadows and highlights, ensuring all details are visible. The desk has a smooth wooden texture with a matte finish to avoid reflections. The background is a pure white, free of any visual artifacts or distractions, providing a clean slate for 3D reconstruction.",
  "image_prompt": "Create a 4x4 grid of sixteen high-resolution digital images of a desk, each showing a distinct view: include precise angles like the front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and twelve varying oblique angles from different heights and corners. Ensure the lighting is consistent and diffused across all images to prevent shadows and highlights from obscuring details, and maintain sharp focus for clarity across the entire desk surface. The desk should be made of a smooth, matte wood to prevent glare. The background must be completely white, free from any artifacts, ensuring no distractions. Each view should be clearly labeled and distinct to aid in 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image provides 16 distinct views of a desk, meticulously captured to facilitate accurate 3D reconstruction. Key improvements include the consistent diffused lighting to enhance image quality, sharp focus on all desk details, distinct and correctly labeled views, and a completely neutral background to avoid distractions. These enhancements directly address previous feedback on image quality, lighting consistency, and labeling accuracy.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 5/10\n- The lighting is inconsistent across the images, with noticeable shadows and highlights that vary between views.\n- Some images appear slightly blurred, and there are visible compression artifacts.\n- The background is not completely neutral, with shadows affecting the clarity.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 4/10\n- The images do not consistently match the metadata; the presence of additional objects like chairs and boxes is not indicated.\n- The labeling of views is inconsistent and unclear.\n\nCompleteness: 4/10\n- The coverage is inadequate for 3D reconstruction, with several important angles missing.\n- The views are not distinctly different; some are repetitive and do not provide new information.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and highlights that obscure details.\n- Improve image resolution and reduce compression to eliminate artifacts and blurring.\n- Use a completely neutral background to enhance object visibility.\n- Ensure each view is distinctly different and covers all necessary angles for reconstruction.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Clearly specify the presence of additional objects and ensure they are consistently included.\n- Use a standardized labeling system for views to avoid confusion.\n- Include detailed descriptions of the desired angles and lighting conditions in the metadata.",
    "suggestions_for_improvement": "Scoring penalties applied: Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and highlights that obscure details. - Improve image resolution and reduce compression to eliminate artifacts and blurring. - Use a completely neutral background to enhance object visibility. - Ensure each view is distinctly different and covers all necessary angles for reconstruction.",

    "previous_suggestions": "Scoring penalties applied: Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and highlights that obscure details. - Improve focus and clarity, particularly in images where the desk's surface details are not sharp. - Correct the labeling to ensure each view is distinct and accurately described. - Remove any visual artifacts and ensure a completely neutral background.",
    "previous_metadata_suggestions": "- Clearly define each angle in the metadata to avoid repetition and ensure accurate labeling. - Specify lighting conditions to maintain consistency across all images. - Include instructions for maintaining a neutral background to avoid distractions. **Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:** - The lighting inconsistency is a major flaw that affects the overall quality. - Redundant angles and incorrect labeling significantly reduce the completeness score. - The background, while mostly neutral, has minor artifacts that should be addressed."
