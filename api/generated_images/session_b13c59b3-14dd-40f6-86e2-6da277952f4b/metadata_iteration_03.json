  "generation_metadata": "This visualization includes a bird depicted from sixteen separate angles, forming a 4x4 grid aimed at 3D reconstruction applications. The specific viewpoints are: direct front, direct back, perfect left, perfect right, top-down, bottom-up, and a series of oblique angles at precise 30 and 45-degree increments such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front-left, top-front-right, top-back-left, and top-back-right. Lighting is critical; it uses evenly distributed, multi-directional diffused lighting to highlight fine details and textures of the bird's plumage and structure, avoiding harsh shadows or reflections. The materials in focus are the vibrant coloration of the feathers, their texture, and the natural features such as the beak and claws. Geometric accuracy is maintained by ensuring the bird is perfectly centered in each frame, with a uniform scale to maintain proportional relationships between views. A pure white background is selected to eliminate visual clutter and enhance the edges of the bird, facilitating seamless digital extraction and model generation.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a bird captured from distinct angles, including front, back, left, right, top, and bottom views, plus various 30 and 45-degree oblique angles. Each view focuses on the bird centered in the frame, under consistent, diffused lighting with a pure white background, tailored for 3D reconstruction purposes.",
  "description": "The generated output captures a bird's form and features through sixteen carefully chosen angles, providing a comprehensive dataset for detailed 3D model reconstruction. The uniform lighting ensures clarity and detail in each view, while the angles selected cover a wide range of perspectives to accurately render the object's geometry in digital models.",
