  "generation_metadata": "The image will display a bird through sixteen distinct perspectives, organized in a 4x4 grid for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. Specific views include: exact front view, exact back view, side profiles (left and right), top view, bottom view, and incremental angles such as 45-degree oblique views (e.g., front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back). The lighting is optimized for consistency, using soft, diffused sources at multiple points to reduce shadows and highlight the bird's natural textures without glare. Material properties focus on accurately capturing feather details and natural coloration. Each view ensures the bird remains centered and is scaled uniformly for correlation analysis between images. The pure white backdrop clarifies the bird's silhouette, enhancing edge detection required for digital modeling.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a bird captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the bird from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles such as 45-degree perspectives. The bird is centered in each view, with consistent diffused lighting and uniform scale. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "Generated is an image showcasing a bird across sixteen views, each shot from meticulously defined angles to facilitate detailed 3D model construction. Improvements include enhanced lighting consistency across diverse angles, ensuring clear visibility of all features necessary for accurate reconstruction.",
