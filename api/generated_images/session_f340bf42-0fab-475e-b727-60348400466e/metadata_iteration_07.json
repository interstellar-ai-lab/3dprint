  "generation_metadata": "This image generation involves creating a 4x4 grid of a modern sport car captured from 16 distinct angles, suitable for 3D reconstruction. The car's appearance remains identical across all views, with only the camera angles changing. The angles include front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique perspectives such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. Each sub-image features the car centered in pure white space with consistent lighting and no shadows, textures, or background elements. This approach addresses previous issues related to angle diversity, grid layout, and background consistency.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.",
  "description": "The generated image is a 4x4 grid of a modern sport car captured from 16 distinct angles, intended for 3D reconstruction purposes. The improvements focus on ensuring diverse angle coverage, maintaining a consistent, clean background, and achieving perfect grid alignment. The car appears identical across all views, with changes only in the viewing angles, addressing previous feedback and iteration learnings effectively.",

    "short_summary": "Image Quality: 4/10\n- The lighting is inconsistent, with visible shadows that should not be present.",
    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 4/10\n- The lighting is inconsistent, with visible shadows that should not be present. The reflections on the car are distracting and not uniform across the images. The resolution appears acceptable, but the presence of shadows and reflections detracts significantly from the quality.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 3/10\n- The image does not match the metadata requirements. There are shadows and reflections, which contradict the requirement for a pure white background. The car is not consistently centered, and the angles are not distinct enough to cover the full 360-degree sphere.\n\nCompleteness: 3/10\n- The grid is not a perfect 4x4 layout. The central image disrupts the grid format, and the angles are not sufficiently diverse. The top and bottom views are missing, and the oblique angles are not well-represented.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid layout without any central or overlapping images.\n- Remove all shadows and reflections to maintain a pure white background.\n- Include all required angles, such as top and bottom, and ensure each angle is distinct.\n- Center the car in each sub-image and maintain consistent lighting across all views.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Specify the need for no shadows or reflections more explicitly.\n- Emphasize the requirement for a perfect 4x4 grid with equal spacing and no central or overlapping images.\n- Clarify the need for distinct angles, including top and bottom views, to ensure full coverage.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The grid is disrupted by a central image, failing the 4x4 requirement.\n- Shadows and reflections violate the pure white background requirement.\n- Missing top and bottom views, with insufficient angle diversity.\n- The car is not consistently centered, affecting object consistency across views.",
