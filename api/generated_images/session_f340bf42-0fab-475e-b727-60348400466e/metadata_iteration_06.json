The object is a sleek, aerodynamic modern sport car with a glossy finish, low profile tires, and distinctive headlights. The views include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). Each sub-image maintains consistent lighting, scale, and positioning with the car centered in each view. The background is a pure white space with no shadows or additional objects, ensuring focus solely on the car. The sub-images are perfectly aligned in a 4x4 grid, critical for precise 3D reconstruction. This approach addresses previous issues of angle diversity, grid layout, and background clarity by ensuring each angle is unique and the grid setup is flawless, building on historical feedback and avoiding past errors.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image is a 4x4 grid of a modern sport car shown from 16 different angles, designed for 3D reconstruction. Each sub-image presents the car from a unique perspective, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the car's geometry.
