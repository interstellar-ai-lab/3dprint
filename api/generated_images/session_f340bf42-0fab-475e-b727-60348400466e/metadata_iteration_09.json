Each angle is carefully chosen to cover the full 360-degree sphere around the car, including primary angles (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) and 10 additional oblique angles (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). The object is consistently lit and centered in each sub-image, with a completely pure white background. The sport car's appearance, details, and characteristics remain identical across all views. The grid is perfectly aligned, with equal spacing between all sub-images, ensuring no overlap or misalignment. The emphasis is on maintaining object consistency and angle diversity, addressing previous feedback on grid layout and background purity.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image features a modern sport car presented in a 4x4 grid with 16 different views, meticulously captured from various angles for comprehensive 3D reconstruction. This setup ensures angle diversity and consistent object representation, addressing previous feedback on grid alignment and background cleanliness.
