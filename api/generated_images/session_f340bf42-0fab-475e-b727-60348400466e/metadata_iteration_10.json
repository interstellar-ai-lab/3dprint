The grid includes exactly 16 distinct views captured from unique 3D angles. The views cover primary angles such as front, back, left, right, top, and bottom, as well as 10 additional oblique angles (e.g., front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back). The car is consistently lit and centered within a pure white background, free of any shadows or additional elements. Each sub-image is of equal size, ensuring a perfectly aligned grid with no overlap, crucial for 3D modeling. The object remains identical in appearance across all views. Previous issues such as angle diversity, grid layout, and background purity have been addressed by ensuring distinct angles and a perfectly neutral background. The resolution and focus have been enhanced to improve image quality.\",\n    \"image_prompt\": \"A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sport car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sport car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sport car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The modern sport car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.\",\n    \"description\": \"The generated image features a modern sport car in a 4x4 grid layout, showing 16 distinct angles essential for 3D reconstruction.
