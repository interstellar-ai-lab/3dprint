However, I can offer some general guidance on what to look for in a 3D reconstruction image set:\n\n### Evaluation Criteria:\n\n**1. Image Quality:**\n   - Ensure clarity, resolution, and focus are consistent across all images.\n   - Lighting should be even and professional, without shadows or reflections.\n\n**2. Metadata Accuracy:**\n   - The image should match the intended description, including the object and background specifications.\n\n**3. Completeness:**\n   - Verify that all required angles are covered, including front, back, sides, top, bottom, and oblique angles.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n\n- **Grid Layout:** Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid with 16 distinct images. Each image should be clearly separated and aligned.\n- **Background Consistency:** The background must be pure white with no distractions.\n- **Angle Diversity:** Each image should show a unique angle, covering the full 360-degree sphere.\n- **Object Consistency:** The object should appear identical in all images, with only the angle changing.\n\n### Metadata Suggestions:\n\n- Clarify any discrepancies between the intended and actual outputs.\n- Ensure the prompt specifies all necessary details for accurate generation.\n\n### Critical Checks:\n\n- **4x4 Grid:** Confirm the presence of a perfect grid with no single large images.\n- **Background:** Verify a clean, pure white background with no additional elements.\n- **Object Consistency:** Ensure the object remains the same across all views.\n- **Angle Diversity:** Check for unique and comprehensive angle coverage.\n\nFor a more accurate evaluation, ensure these criteria are met in the image set.",
