    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 4/10\n- The images show noticeable inconsistencies in lighting and focus. The presence of grid lines and varying shadows detracts from the clarity and visual quality needed for 3D reconstruction.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 3/10\n- The image fails to meet the metadata requirements. It does not display a perfect 4x4 grid of 16 distinct images. The backgrounds are not pure white, and the object is not consistently centered.\n\nCompleteness: 2/10\n- The coverage of angles is inadequate. There are not 16 distinctly different 3D angles, and the primary and oblique angles are not clearly represented. The grid is incomplete and misaligned.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid layout with 16 distinct images, each clearly separated and aligned.\n- Maintain a pure white background with no grid lines or shadows to ensure consistency.\n- Capture 16 unique angles, including the 6 primary and 10 oblique angles, to cover the full 360-degree sphere.\n- Ensure the car is centered and identical in each view, with consistent lighting and no visual artifacts.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Clearly specify the requirement for a pure white background and the exclusion of grid lines or shadows.\n- Emphasize the need for 16 distinct angles, ensuring complete 360-degree coverage.\n- Reinforce the importance of object consistency across all views, with only the viewing angle changing.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The grid is not a perfect 4x4 layout, which is a major flaw for 3D reconstruction.\n- Background inconsistencies and object misalignment are significant issues.\n- The lack of distinct angles and the presence of visual artifacts heavily penalize the scores.",
