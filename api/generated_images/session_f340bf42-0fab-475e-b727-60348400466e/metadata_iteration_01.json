  "target_object": "a modern sports car",
  "generation_metadata": "The modern sports car is characterized by sleek, aerodynamic lines and a low-profile body indicative of high performance and speed. It features a metallic silver finish with a glossy sheen, accentuating its sleek curves and sharp edges. The car has a prominent front grille, sporty LED headlights, and a streamlined roofline that tapers toward the rear. Large, alloy wheels with low-profile tires emphasize its sporty nature. The interior, though not visible, is implied to be luxurious and technologically advanced. The 16 views should capture this car from every possible angle: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles such as front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, and bottom-back. Lighting should be consistent, highlighting the car's features without casting shadows on the pure white background. The car's appearance, including color, texture, and details, must remain identical across all views. This metadata serves to guide the generation of views suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "image_prompt": "A PERFECT 4x4 grid layout containing exactly sixteen individual digital photographs, arranged in 4 rows and 4 columns, featuring the EXACT SAME modern sports car captured from 16 DISTINCTLY DIFFERENT 3D angles. Each of the 16 sub-images must be clearly separated and show the IDENTICAL modern sports car from a UNIQUE 3D viewpoint covering the full 360-degree sphere around the object. The 16 angles must include: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and 10 additional oblique angles distributed evenly around the 3D space (front-left, front-right, back-left, back-right, top-front, top-back, top-left, top-right, bottom-front, bottom-back, etc.). Each grid position must show a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT 3D angle - no two grids should have similar viewpoints. The object's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all 16 views - only the 3D viewing angle changes. The modern sports car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. CRITICAL: ONLY the modern sports car should be visible - NO other objects, items, accessories, or environmental elements. The background must be COMPLETELY PURE WHITE with NO shadows, textures, patterns, or any other elements. The modern sports car should appear to float in pure white space, suitable for 3D reconstruction. CRITICAL: This MUST be a perfect 4x4 grid with exactly 16 individual sub-images, not a single large image.",
  "description": "The generated image consists of a 4x4 grid showcasing a modern sports car from 16 distinct angles, ensuring comprehensive coverage for 3D reconstruction. Each view maintains the car's consistent appearance, emphasizing its sleek design and metallic finish. The consistent pure white background ensures clarity and focus on the car, facilitating accurate 3D modeling. This setup can be used to reconstruct a detailed 3D model of the car, suitable for virtual reality, gaming, or automotive design analysis.",
