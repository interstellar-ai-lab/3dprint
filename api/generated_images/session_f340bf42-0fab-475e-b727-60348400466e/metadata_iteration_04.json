The clarity and resolution need improvement for 3D reconstruction.\n\n### Metadata Accuracy: 2/10\n- **Issues:** The image doesn't match the intended metadata. The presence of grid lines and potential background elements are not aligned with the requirement for a pure white background.\n\n### Completeness: 2/10\n- **Issues:** The grid does not appear to be a perfect 4x4 layout with distinct angles. The presence of additional elements (like car parts) suggests incomplete or incorrect coverage.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. **4x4 Grid Layout:** Ensure a perfect 4x4 grid with 16 distinct images, each clearly separated and aligned.\n2. **Background Consistency:** Maintain a pure white background with no grid lines or shadows.\n3. **Angle Diversity:** Capture 16 unique angles, including the 6 primary and 10 oblique angles, to cover the full 360-degree sphere.\n4. **Object Consistency:** Ensure the car is centered and identical in each view, with consistent lighting and no visual artifacts.\n\n### Metadata Suggestions:\n1. **Clarify Background Requirements:** Emphasize the need for a pure white background without any grid lines or shadows.\n2. **Angle Specification:** Clearly specify the requirement for 16 distinct angles, ensuring complete 360-degree coverage.\n3. **Object Consistency:** Reinforce the importance of object consistency across all views, with only the viewing angle changing.\n\n### Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- **4x4 Grid Requirement:** The grid must be perfect; any deviation is a major flaw.\n- **Lighting Consistency:** Lighting must be perfectly consistent across all views.\n- **Angle Uniqueness:** Each view must show a distinctly different 3D angle.\n- **Background Purity:** The background must be completely clean and neutral.\n- **Object Consistency:** The object must be identical across all views.\n\nAddress these issues to improve the suitability of the image for 3D reconstruction.",
