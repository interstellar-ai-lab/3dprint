MUST address the specific issues from previous feedback: Scoring penalties applied: First iteration penalty: -2 points; First iteration penalty: -2 points; Lighting issues: -1 point image quality; Angle/view issues: -1 point completeness; Background issues: -1 point image quality; Improvement suggestions found: -1 point each for scores >7; Quality issues: -2 points image quality. - Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and highlights that differ. - Improve focus and sharpness in each view to enhance clarity. - Use a perfectly neutral background to eliminate any distractions. - Capture more varied angles to provide a complete 360-degree view. CRITICAL: Object details must remain identical across all views.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring the EXACT SAME cat captured from different viewing angles only. Each sub-image shows the IDENTICAL cat from distinct viewpoints: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and twelve additional oblique angles, including upper-left, upper-right, lower-left, lower-right, and intermediate rotations at 30-degree intervals around the object. The cat's appearance, details, and characteristics remain COMPLETELY IDENTICAL across all views - only the viewing angle changes. The lighting is uniform and diffuse, eliminating shadows and highlights that differ across images. Each view is in sharp focus and high definition, ensuring clarity. The background is pure white, perfectly neutral, with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction. The cat is centered in each view, maintaining consistent scale and positioning throughout the grid.",
  "description": "The generated image is a 4x4 grid displaying 16 different views of the same cat, meticulously captured to ensure identical object features across all perspectives. This collection of images addresses previous feedback by maintaining consistent and diffuse lighting, ensuring high focus and clarity, and providing a pure white background. The angles are varied with precision to offer a comprehensive 360-degree view, enhancing the set's effectiveness for 3D reconstruction. The improvements over the previous iteration include better lighting uniformity, sharper focus, and a wider range of distinct angles, all while preserving object consistency.",

    "markdown_report": "**Image Quality: 5/10**  \nThe images display decent clarity and resolution, but there are noticeable inconsistencies in lighting across the views. Some images appear slightly overexposed, while others are underexposed. The focus is not uniformly sharp, leading to a lack of crispness in some views. The background, although neutral, has minor artifacts that detract from the overall quality.\n\n**Metadata Accuracy: 4/10**  \nThe labeling of angles is inconsistent and confusing, with some labels being unclear or incorrect (e.g., \"Top\" appears multiple times with different views). This discrepancy between the labels and actual views significantly impacts the metadata accuracy.\n\n**Completeness: 3/10**  \nThe set fails to provide a comprehensive 16-view coverage. Many angles are repeated or too similar, and critical perspectives are missing. This lack of distinct angles makes the set unsuitable for accurate 3D reconstruction.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**  \n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid overexposure or underexposure.\n- Improve focus and sharpness to enhance clarity.\n- Remove background artifacts for a cleaner look.\n- Correctly label each angle to match the actual view presented.\n- Provide a true 16-view coverage with distinct and varied angles.\n\n**Metadata Suggestions:**  \n- Clearly define and standardize angle labels to match the actual views.\n- Ensure metadata accurately reflects the content and sequence of images.\n- Include detailed descriptions for each view to improve clarity and usability.\n\n**Extremely Critical Evaluation Points:**  \n- The lighting inconsistency is a major flaw that needs immediate correction.\n- The repeated and unclear angle labeling severely impacts metadata accuracy.\n- The lack of distinct angles makes the set inadequate for 3D reconstruction.\n- Object consistency is acceptable, but the issues in quality and completeness overshadow this aspect.",
