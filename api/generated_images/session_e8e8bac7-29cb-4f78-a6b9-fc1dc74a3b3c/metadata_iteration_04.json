  "target_object": "a cat",
  "generation_metadata": "The object is a single, specific cat, captured in 16 distinct viewpoints arranged in a 4x4 grid for 3D reconstruction. Each sub-image must present the cat from a unique angle, including front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique views. The cat must maintain identical visual characteristics across all images, including size, shape, color, texture, and material properties. Consistent lighting is essential to avoid shadows and ensure clarity, with focus and resolution improved to eliminate blurring and artifacts. Each view is accurately labeled to correspond to its intended angle, ensuring distinct perspectives. The cat is centered in every view, and the background is pure white to prevent distractions, optimizing conditions for 3D reconstruction. Object consistency is critical, with identical details in all views, differing only in camera positions.",
  "image_prompt": "A 4x4 grid of sixteen digital photographs showing the EXACT SAME cat from different viewing angles, specifically addressing previous issues. The cat must remain IDENTICAL across all views, with consistent size, shape, color, texture, and details. Only the viewing angles vary: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. Use uniform lighting to eliminate shadows and maintain clarity, enhancing focus and resolution to prevent blurring and artifacts. Each view is clearly labeled to match the intended angle, ensuring distinct perspectives. The cat is centered in each photograph, with a pure white background free of shadows or objects. This setup is optimized for 3D reconstruction, with strictly maintained object consistency and only varying camera positions.",
  "description": "This set of images presents a single cat captured in 16 different views, arranged in a 4x4 grid. Each image maintains the cat's identical characteristics, differing only in the camera angle to provide comprehensive coverage for 3D reconstruction. Improvements include consistent lighting, enhanced resolution, accurate angle labeling, and a neutral background, addressing previous feedback and ensuring high-quality reconstruction potential.",

    "markdown_report": "Image Quality: 5/10\n- The images have decent clarity and resolution, but there are noticeable inconsistencies in lighting and focus. Some images appear slightly blurred, and the lighting is not perfectly consistent across all views.\n\nMetadata Accuracy: 4/10\n- The labeling is inconsistent and unclear. Some labels are misspelled or incorrect, leading to confusion about the intended angles and views.\n\nCompleteness: 4/10\n- The set lacks a full 16-view coverage. Several angles are repeated, and some important perspectives are missing. The object is not perfectly centered in all images.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n- Ensure consistent lighting across all images to avoid shadows and variations.\n- Improve focus and clarity to eliminate any blurriness.\n- Center the cat perfectly in each view to maintain consistency.\n- Provide a complete 16-view set with distinct angles for each image.\n\nMetadata Suggestions:\n- Correct spelling errors and ensure labels accurately describe each view.\n- Use a systematic labeling approach to clearly indicate the angle and perspective of each image.\n\nExtremely Critical Evaluation Points:\n- The object consistency is lacking; there are slight variations in the cat's appearance across images.\n- The background is not entirely clean, with some shadows and artifacts present.\n- The viewing angles are not distinct enough, with several repeated or similar perspectives.\n- The grid format is not strictly adhered to, with missing and repeated views affecting completeness.",
