  "generation_metadata": "The image contains 16 views of a modem sport car, each in a 4x4 grid layout. The views include: front view, rear view, left side view, right side view, top view, bottom view, and several oblique angles (front-left, front-right, rear-left, rear-right, top-front, top-rear, bottom-front, bottom-rear). The lighting is uniform across all images, highlighting the car's glossy surface and intricate design details. The car is centered in each view, maintaining an identical scale and orientation. The background is a plain white, ensuring no shadows or distractions, which is ideal for 3D reconstruction tasks.",
  "image_prompt": "A set of sixteen digital photographs arranged in a 4x4 grid featuring a modem sport car captured from different angles. Each sub-image shows the modem sport car from a distinct viewpoint: front, back, left, right, top, bottom, and various oblique angles. The modem sport car is centered in each view, with consistent lighting, scale, and positioning. The background is pure white with no shadows or other objects, suitable for 3D reconstruction.",
  "description": "The generated image provides a comprehensive set of 16 perspectives of a modem sport car, with consistent lighting and positioning, suitable for 3D modeling and reconstruction. It offers various angles, capturing the car's design from all essential viewpoints, aiding in the accurate creation of a 3D model.",
